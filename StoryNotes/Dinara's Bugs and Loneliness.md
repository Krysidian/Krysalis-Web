# Dinara's Bugs and Loneliness

Maybe Dinara's bug manifestations can also represent her loneliness as it's basically her externalizing beings she can talk to when alone. She's afraid to talk to people so this is easier but it's also a self destructive habit of hers so it's like maggots eating her from the inside. #story/character/dinara #backstory [[Dinara]]
