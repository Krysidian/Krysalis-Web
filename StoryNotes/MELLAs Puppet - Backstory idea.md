# MELLAs Puppet


ACID GIRLs puppet, her former friend has seen her in all reflections slowly driving him insane. In an attempt to hide her he covered everything reflective in black tape ([[Special Bandages with anomalous properties]]) that's similar to vantablack (pitch black and also toxic). He now has tape all around him, especially his torn off face and eyes which makes it seem like parts of him are floating. He is someone that was so utterly broken by what he had done that he chose to live in blissful ignorance, together with her again. He has no [[INTENT]] or purpose in this world and completely succumbed to her and and his own guilt.
