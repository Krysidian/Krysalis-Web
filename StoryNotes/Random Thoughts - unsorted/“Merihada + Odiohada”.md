# “Merihada + Odiohada”


The Merihada and Odiohada live near steep walls and tall mountains. Not all of them can fly, especially at a young age. They carefully climb these walls like Ibex and are instinctively calm when climbing them, since fear and startlement would lead to death. Therefore they seem to have a liking for walls because of its calming nature that makes them very introspective as well.

⚠️Still gotta figure out how I can incoorperate them in the world or if they should be taken out⚠️
