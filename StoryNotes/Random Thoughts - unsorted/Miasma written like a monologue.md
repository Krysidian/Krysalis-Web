# Miasma written like a monologue





The "Plague Doctor" is a curious figure. No-one knows who it is or where it came from. It's even unclear if it used to be human or is something entirely outside of our comprehension. But one thing seems certain. It has principles, rules. Rules people should play by should they choose to engage with the veiled figure. And surprisingly at lot of people, revenants in particular seem compelled to strike a deal with the unidentifiable devil. You see, Revenants seem to naturally understand the doctor's intentions without a word spoken. Should you be in the same undead state and happen to cross paths with this entity, it will offer you a once-in-a-lifetime deal: It will grant you immortality. Yes, no kidding. Im-mor-tali-ty. Well, sort of. You will have to put your life in the doctor's hands - literally. Offer your Desmocore and it will enforce and protect it. When in the apparition's possession, your desmocore will become borderline unbreakable. Harder than diamond. "But I'd still be connected to it. I'd have to stay in close proximity or I'd perish" you might say. But that's the real deal. It can offer you INFINITE proximity. You can roam free, unshackled from your crystallized prison. Basically unkillable since your foes will never find where to strike. A fully freed body. But an even more confined mind. Nope, I don't mean that it can mind-control you know, that'd be too simple. Your mind, stored inside the crystal is literally trapped within its grasp. If that's not a thought that will chill you to your core I don't know what will. Maybe, that it's still breakable. But only if you- your body is close enough as well.

And now here is the catch I built up to the entire time. After you struck the deal with the figure, it will give you a timer or a date, which will differ from client to client. It's the time you have left - to run and hide. And you better use that time very wisely. Because after your time runs out it will start searching for you. And it won't stop. No matter what. It does not hunger, it does not feel exhaustion. It's not ambition that drives it to hunt you. It's more like a physical force, a law. And you cannot outrun that. You can only buy time and convince yourself of the opposite.

Only a fool would strike a deal with it, to trade your own soul and remnants of sanity for supposed immortality. Just so you can live in fear until the inevitable will strip you from all of your delusions. But you also wouldn't believe how many fools walk around here.

**“Give up all of of you and receive unending life”**
