# Scoop+Dinara - Environmental themes



**Beach**

-   Dinara's yearn for a Childhood lost. Inspired by the beaches of France, School trips and missed opportunities.
-   Overwhelming nature of her surroundings that are too much for her most of the time
-   Edge of the world - A dead end? The end in general? Or new Horizons?

**Tundra**

-   _SCOOPs traumatic experienced that made him what he is now. (Inspired by the Donner Party, Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571_ ⚠️ This may be changed completely ⚠️ #toBeChanged 
-   Isolation and loneliness
-   silent, sounds being drowned out by the snow
-   cold and stagnant, like Scoops life and character development
-   deep issues buried beneath thick layers of snow and ash

**Desert**

-   New and unknown land for them both.
-   The future. Terrifying and brutal beyond relief but also full of potential.
-   Here in a more negative tone, since the desert can be a place where life once prospered yet now everything has withered away.
-   Can represent both of them trying to deal and coming to terms with their existence after death. **One that may be eternal like the wastelands of the desert**

**Rain**

-   Since snow is connected to SCOOPs vicious and cold childhood, rain represents his later adult life before death.
-   A time where he seemed to have found someone that could warm his heart again. But since that time and the important person with it has perished as well, it leaves a bittersweet taste in his mouth.
-   A melancholic and regretful weather where his cold demeanor seems to melt and crumble from time to time. THE GASSER (being exacly that important person, or at least representing his guilt) can create pitch black rainclouds from all the gas and rain down black and lethal liquid representing the underlying toxicity in their flawed relationship, together with a lot od grudges that persisted beyond both of their deaths
