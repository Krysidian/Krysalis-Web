# Shapeless Manifesting as a black cat



possible idea.

Manifestation of Shapeless can be rather cute and unseeming. Maybe inspired by those pitch black cats with their tongues hanging out.

Perhaps an artist witnessed something unbelievable with that shapeless figure, decides to create a story out of said experience and becomes somewhat famous. Or at least famous enough to be in popular pop culture and having merchandise, like plushies etc.

Basically manifesting shapeless - the right hand and effigy of the divinity all over the world (obviously somewhat inspired by Cal)

The marketed variant of Shapeless is the prime way to spread the memetic disease that enables the divinity to indirectly manipulate everyone infested by it.
