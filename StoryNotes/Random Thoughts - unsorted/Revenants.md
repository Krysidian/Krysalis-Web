# Revenants

### How Revenants work, kinda

Revenants have an urge to seek vengeance towards their original killer. Revenants that transformed and died during the normal process don't have a direct fixation and are therefore a lot more dangerous. If someone is infected you have two choices. Kill him yourself and take the burden of having a revenge hungry zombie or let him die by normal means that will turn him into a more variable killer machine. If a human is turned into a revenant by another revenant they will form some sort of leader-servant relationship, the killer being the leader. Revenants with a huge kill count have a bigger army that will support them like a hive mind. They do have some sort of free mind but have a natural urge to obey their killer. Ex: The Wendigo has an army of servants consisting of his victims he decided to not eat (completely) The Sachem turned an entire town into a necropolis that is under his control This behavior makes the formation of groups and "nations" fast and efficient. Most necropolis are a dictatorship. Revenants like the Mad Gasser are especially dangerous since they are mass killers and can turn entire towns into revenants under its service (this is not really the case since his victims dissolve completely, his revenants would be 100% gaseous)

Some revenants intentionally infect normal humans to "harvest" their developed desmocore after they transformed. This sort of bounty hunting creates a horrific "profession" for a lot of Revenants since they trade the (deactivated, not destroyed) desmocores. Very smart Revenants try to "reconnect" theses crystals with other revenants to create a shared "life system" that pretty much works like a "cloud" for life. The information is distributed over multiple cores that can work as backups - meaning that all crystals have to be destroyed in order to kill the revenant. This would make a lot of them near immortal. Desmocores of important people are way more valuable than "regular" crystals. Crystal-Bounty becomes a popular business amongst revenants in no time. [[Desmocore]]

## Revenants:

It's the idea of so-called "Revenants". People, mainly humans being infected by the gaseous liquid of scours directly or by a human-made replica of that substance.

It slowly overtakes the body, eventually killing the host. (symptoms aren't visible and are mainly internal) A small crystal, called the desmocore (similar to scour desmocores) will form inside the throat where the esophagus and the windpipe join. The majority of subjects die of suffocation or starvation.

People that died in that manner will start to show bodily activity again after the crystal has fully formed and will seem alive at first ("Vigor Mortis". What most don't notice is that all the information of the host's consciousness and body activity (basically the entirety of the brain) was "copied" onto the desmocore. Meaning that it is the new source of "life" for that individual.

This also means that any damage to the heart, brain or head in general is essentially meaningless (the normal zombie technique does not work). A Revenant can only be killed by destroying the crystal within their throat.

Converted people that died because of the progress will act more violently and viciously. They start to act rude and develop psychopathic traits. This is caused by the increased strength of the most inner and animalistic desires. They act like the "Id" (structure model of the psyche - Sigmund Freud) would. The variable of moral and modesty vanished.

But of course behavior is always dependent on the person infected. They are undead but not zombies, since they retain all of their memories and overall character traits.

What truly makes a revenant scary is also the reason they got their name.

If an infected person is killed by someone before the transformation finished, the process will speed up, almost instantly converting the person into a revenant. Just like their folklore counterparts, the revenants here are known for their eternal grudges and almost unstoppable desire to avenge their own demise. People who kill someone that ends up as a revenant will forever be haunted and eventually murdered by them. The whole drive for THOSE revenants is vengeance. Once their killer is killed they mostly seem to calm down and act more idle.

Revenants that weren't created because of murder (like the first example I have mentioned) are even more malicious though. Since they aren't "bound" or fixated to a certain killer they are able to think and act freely on their putrid behavior.

A person facing another infected person would fall into a specific predicament. They either leave the person to die and convert which would create an enormous hazard or they could kill them themselves. But this would attract the revenant's grudge onto them.

Revenants gained abilities similar to that of a scour: An unharmed revenant would have no special abilities aside from increased strength and intellect. But upon serious harm, like losing an arm a new process would initiate. Every separated part of the body will start to dissolve and turn into the gaseous, shape-shifting substance. This gas is controlled by the crystal and can even reform intself into the lost body part, but also other shapes.

That basically means, the more a revenant is hurt the more dangerous and adaptive they get.

Some even learn to hurt themselves strategically to basically modify and weaponize their body.

But they do feel the pain when suffering the damage the first time. After that they are basically numb there.

Another interesting case would be when a Revenant kills an infected person. In that case, the killed and converted individual would not form a desire of vengeance but would instead surrender and act subordinate, even loyal to their killer. This grotesque killer-victim-dynamic is able to create a sort of "hierarchy" within a group of revenants where the first converted person would be in control of the rest. It's basically a process that prevents these revenants from tearing each other apart. Different "tribes/clans" would be vicious to each other though.

This makes groups of revenants extremely cunning, calculating and absolutely lethal.

_And yet, despite their cruel and disturbing nature, they still somewhat retain their original character. They are still the person they were before, some might argue. This makes them dangerous because of their ability to manipulate. Then again, maybe that means that not all of them are lost causes. Perhaps some small sliver of humanity is still left within them._




>[!abstract]- Summary
>Revenants are undead creatures created when a person is infected with a gaseous liquid that eventually kills them and forms a crystal in their throat called the desmocore. Revenants retain their memories and character traits and have an urge to seek vengeance towards their killer. They can also infect others to form a hierarchy or army of servants. Revenants become more dangerous when harmed, as they gain abilities similar to those of the gaseous liquid that infected them. They can be killed by destroying the desmocore in their throat, but this is difficult as they feel no pain after the initial harm. Revenants are dangerous because they can manipulate others and retain some sliver of humanity.
