# Spinal Eye

Revenant with the big horns coming from his eye sockets used to be a big pal of Namida and a secondary member of the friend group I want to center some of his characteristics around smell which could complement Namida's focus on taste.

**Metaphorical Design choice:** The moment the third horn emerges from his nostrils and forms the algiz rune, his last piece of humanity has withered away.

SPINEEYE or the other nickname "One-Shot" is a former friend of Namida. Turned insane after witnessing the revelatoin of the divinity and the universe's connection to it. Wants to stop the prophecy by killing everyone that is involved with it. Only sparing Namida, simply because of his strong bond and relationship with her, which is ironic since she plays a MAJOR role in the happenings of the final judgement. He forces himself to become a revenant and tries to become a ruthless and efficient killer. He does never enjoy the killings he does and focuses on killing his victims as fast as possible. the main reason he chooses firearms over his actual skills in melee combat. He is known for saying "one" out loud after shooting someone since he is counting the seconds it takes for his target to die. It almost never takes longer than one second.
