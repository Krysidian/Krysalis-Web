# Dinara and Scoop - More on Both Origins



a girl that seemingly had everything.

A rich family, decent education, an opportunity at life without obstacles. Yet neglected by her parents, never learning the importance of socializing or confidence, eventually restraining herself within her own, desolate mind.

A man that had nothing yet lost everything gets a chance at life. Only a brief intermission as that hope gets taken away in a blink of an eye.

Desperate and vulnerable he, who already had a scratched and withered mind, reached out to the only reaching hand he had.

A rich man with a plan and recources to freeze that hope in time. At the cost of the man's free will. An irreversible contract that brought out the worst in him, something he stored away all those years ago. Just for a chance at someone else's life again. The man eventually died, used up, at the hands of that reaching hand. Something though, stayed within him, made him stand up. Roam and stride aimlessly, his expirition date long overdue. Eventually stumbling across a girl with a familiar face. A daughter he recalls. A daughter of someone he knows. Someone he loathes. Once again, he is granted a chance at something. A choice, one that will define his afterexistence more than he could have ever expected. #toBeChanged
