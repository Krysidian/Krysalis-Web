# mental strength to manipulate own mass


Scours and Revenants use their mental strength to change form and create objects that are not part of their default physique. That means that destabilizing their mental state can also make them return to their normal state, resetting the objects and changes they've made. That also is the reason why most scours don't create weapons and only cool-headed Revenants are able to use their body and mind to their fullest extent.
