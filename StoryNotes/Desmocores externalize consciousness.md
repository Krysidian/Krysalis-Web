# Desmocores externalize consciousness


Since Desmocores are [[Crystallized Consciousness and the Brine of Unconsciousness|Crystallized Consciousness]], perhaps the main ability and the idea of [[INTENT]] come from the crystal externalizing consciousness. Basically bending reality around the crystal holder to what they perceive. This ability is very small and minimal for most and can lead to small changes in their appearance, simple magical abilities (like strength, speed etc.) while holders with that externalize a lot can wield mind and reality bending powers.

Since [[Dinara]] would actually have the deal of [[Miasma]], she would have an extreme level of that phenomenon. That's why her appearance is so distinct and unique. The metal legs and cutlery are a manifestation of how she views herself. Same with the maggots and other critters. That's also why she is able to create "life" and use swarms in the future.


It's an Expansion of the [[Phaneron]]
