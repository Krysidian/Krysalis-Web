Imagine having a constant argument with yourself within, sharing contradicting characteristics and even passions. One fighting for dominance over the other.  

Basically complete strangers trapped within the same body, sharing the same life. What compromises would you have to make in order to please every compartment of your self, to become somewhat whole again?  

  

This is the basic dilemma of Sourire, a patchwork creature called a "SCOUR" which consists of the bodies and minds of other anomalous beings. All living seperate and indipendent lives with unique memories up until the point of amalgamation.  



Describing Sourire as a character is difficult, even for himself. He seems irratic, short tempered and overall rather sour, easily upset but also very apologetic. He struggles to accept himself as a single individual and rather tries to separate himself before inevitably accepting his unpleasent fate.  

  

He is on the unsignposted road to a somewhat normal life, trying to bring seemingly unfitting puzzle pieces together.  

And while he may not have the strength to overcome all his struggles alone, he will have company along the way, making the bumpy road easier to travel:  

  

_Namida_, a stern yet empathetic SCOUR with similar struggles of self-accpetance who sees so much potential in him. And _Xtal_, who seemingly magically overcame his mind struggles and lives a content life as a hybrid.  

  

Maybe he will discover some shared passions within himself like working with pen and ink and indulging himself with old relics and long forgotten history.
