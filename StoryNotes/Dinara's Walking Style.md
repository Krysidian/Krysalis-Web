## Ideas

[[Dinara]] can walk, run, squat etc. as if she had feet, completely unbothered and balanced, even going against gravity. It’s like her feet never disappeared. It did take time for her to get to that point but she managed it pretty naturally. 

Only in [[Scoop|Scoop's]] presence she starts to tremble and lose balance on her rickety metal legs. As if he’s a reminder of her shortcomings, her current fate and scarred body.

She does leave scratches on the floor though and therefore can't go into someone's home without leaving a mark. At least abandoned buildings won't care
