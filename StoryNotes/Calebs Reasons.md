## Ideas


- Maybe he offhandedly promised [[Dinara]] to stay in touch but forgot about her later ^663a5e
- Caleb's a people pleaser and and upstanding, nice guy but sometimes he forgets the things he says
- Maybe the promise happened during prom night where he noticed her melancholic and alone
  This could be the first time he sees or recognizes [[Scoop]] as he escorts her home
	- Also the Reason why Scoop may **Know** about said promise
- he was friendly but never close to her so now he feels guilty for "forgetting her" and that promise.
- He only realizes she is missing after hearing rumors about it during a [[Class Reunion]]
