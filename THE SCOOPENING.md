I feel like the angst that comes from [[Dinara|Dina]] not having any hands can and should be expanded upon, like ask yourself "what's a moment where if I didn't have hands would be fatal"

For ExAmple: Scoop joins the group when [[Caleb]] gets hurt in a fight with other Revenants. [[Dinara]] manages to kill them but in her rage she accidentally slashes across Caleb's arm. He sinks to the ground and is quickly loosing blood, jokingly trying to assure her that he's not mad at her. She's panicking, as he loses consciousness and can't press on the wound himself any more. In desperation, she presses her head(/arm/elbow/you decide what looks less goofy) to his wound but it's not enough. She cries and curses herself, pleading for [[Caleb]] to stay with her.

Scoop appears beside her, offering his help. In her desperation she accepts and he begins to bandage the wound. 
Caleb regains consciousness in a run down hut as he's forcefully but gently being fed with soup by the man who had tried to kill him a few times
I love the absolute crack idea of them in the abandoned house, Scoop feeding [[Caleb]] and him being like "Wtf is this, did you make this?" and Scoop just shrugs and goes "She helped" then cut to a hysterically crying Dina, chopping onions like they killed her family

Maybe another scene before the SCOOPING UP where something bigger happens and the three are forced to fight together for a short while

What if in the scene where [[Caleb]] is bleeding out before the scoopending, [[Dinara]] sees Scoop and actually finally is able to fight back and keep standing because she's protecting Caleb, as she thinks Scoop wants to kill him. As in, in the moment she finally has the strength to fight back is the moment she realises that she doesn't have to

I imagine her absolutely emotionally destroyed, Caleb's blood running down her face mixed with tears, standing up on shaky legs and getting more steady with each step forward. Scoop raises his hands "I'm here to help" But she's already swinging at him, growling "I won't let you kill him", a fight ensues and she's not holding back, while he's trying to dodge. She tries to elbow him in the face and he  catches her arm, pulling her closer so they're face to face. "He's already dying. And you know you can't help him. So let me." the anger on her face melts into despair, the tension leaving her body as she stumbles away from him. 
"One wrong move and he'll be the last thing you lay your hands on" she hisses, holding the knife towards him. 
Scoop raises his hands again in a gesture of innocence and quickly moves towards Caleb. Her eyes follow his every movement. 
Scoop crouches down and begins to tend to his wound, making him secure enough for the moment. "I came by a house not far from here, if we start walking now, we'll make it before nightfall. His chances aren't great, but they'll be better there."
Dinara is tense, her face caught in a state between grief and rage, lips trembling and eyebrows twitching. "Okay."

Scoop hoists [[Caleb]] up to lean on his shoulder and looks towards her, "We'll be faster if you help."

Begrudgingly she walks towards them, enduring as Scoop helps adjust Caleb's weight to be balanced between them (maybe ties Caleb's to Dina's arms as she can't hold on to him)

And they walk together towards the woods.

(aka I have now converted the [[Caleb]] dying in their arms scene into the scooping up, hihi, Please let him live?)

I think it would take a while until the dynamic switches to something good tho! I imagine she'd be on edge for a lot longer than even Caleb, being convinced that this is another [[Lev]]el of cruel perversion. Killing and then stalking her wasn't enough, trying to kill her only friend only then to save him-- she'd probably feel like he's doing this to hurt her or to get closer to her in a creepy way. To get something from her, I have this sentence in my head for her to say in a very emotionally raw moment "You already killed me once. Are you gonna hurt him now just to kill me further?"

**Also please can we have a moment where Scoop finally cracks a little and gives in to her angry jabs of "What do you want" by admitting, ever so quietly "I want you to be safe" 
"Then why did you kill me"**

I like to imagine that after they begin to walk with Caleb, we see a backshot of the three of them and then go into the next page with [[Dinara]] breaking the door open and them taking [[Caleb]] inside and carefully putting him down on a sofa, [[Dinara]] sinking down next to him and Scoop saying he'll look for medical supplies, going off to search through the other rooms.
Dina lays her head on his chest, closing her eyes for a second to better listen for his heartbeat.
Scoop comes back and stays still in the doorframe for a second, a tender expression of pain upon his face. "It's his lucky day, it seems. I found vodka, bandages and painkillers. Also a remarkable amount of onions in the kitchen."

Dina sits up and glares at him "What the fuck are you gonna use the onions for?"

Scoop raises one non-existent eyebrow, as he puts the meds on the couch table and begins to unwrap the mess of Caleb's makeshift bandage to patch [[Caleb]] up properly, "Soup"

Dina's like "what" and he's disinfecting the wound with alcohol like "It'll be good for him. When he wakes up."

Dina's face brightens immediately, careful hope igniting.
Scoop says he'll go outside to look for something edible, tells her that she can get started with the onions if she wants to. 

---Eventual "missing" scene to add the funny onion version afterwards:---
(Dina she moves the onions in place and notices that Caleb's blood still stains her blade. She flinches in horror and rushes to the sink, eager but struggling to wash it off. Somehow she manages to get the water to run but washing the blood off is hard as it's already begun to dry. She aggressively wipes her blade on her shorts, accidentally cutting her own leg. This snaps her out of the frenzy as she takes in a sharp breath, and then turns to take out all her emotions on the innocent vegetables. She cuts and remembers how recklessly she fought, each movement of her blade paralleling a moment in the fight. Tears begin to stream down her face and she let's them.)

Caleb comes to consciousness, with no shirt on and wrapped in bandages and blankets, the light in the house somewhat warm and cozy. [[Dinara]] is sitting on the floor opposite the sofa, staring at a TV screen that's showing old cartoons. Her hair is wet (she dunked her head into the full sink repeatedly to wash off Caleb's blood because she couldn't stomach the idea of Scoop touching her face), she looks drained and has her knees pulled to her torso.
Beside himself he sees a silhouette approach with a spoon.

Regarding [Lost but Never Alone](https://open.spotify.com/track/0pvLcYr3GDlSYp5b2UNdXW?si=af1737c9be2e44c5): 
Addition to that scene: what if it starts snowing out of nowhere, have the snow mirror the static, make the soup more important because warmth is needed badly, makes the fight and their walking off more cinematic, makes the blood appear more striking as it leaves a trail behind the Trio, add in an element of danger as someone could follow their steps, leading to Scoop proving his allegiance by fighting off whoever attacks
