Can we also get like, a scene where Scoop is in danger and he can't get himself out of it so [[Dinara|Dina]] and [[Caleb]] go absolutely balistic to free him? With [[Caleb]] finally unafraid to use violence and [[Dinara]] becoming genuinely terrifying to everyone around her. I think that could be ~~hot~~ interesting. LikeÂ ðŸ‘€narrativelyðŸ‘€

Also I love the idea that Scoop is all like "No don't become like me, this anger will be your downfall" but more and more realising that in some cases, being angry and acting accordingly is exactly what is needed. Their rage is not a flaw, sometimes it's what's needed to protect the ones one cares about. For [[Dinara|Dina]] it could mean reclaiming power that she'sÂ beenÂ denied
