Caleb's main objective is for him to find [[Dinara|Dina]] out of guilt and escaping the feeling of his life being wasted and dull. Maybe this then turns into the desire to learn everything about how the Revenants came to be and how to convince people that not all of them are evil monsters. He wanted to be the hero of his own story again, but slowly he learns that all this is bigger than just him and Dinara. He begins to think like a scientist: small actions and discoveries build on top of one another to contribute to a collective greater good. Maybe he learns that just being a person and doing his best is enough, he doesn't have to be this grand figure to be worth remembering

Scoop starts off with wanting to care for the ones he loves and desperately doing what he can to survive at the cost of his safety and health. He loses the people he cared about the most, gets killed by the people he had to work for and goes on a killing spree in an act of empty revenge. 
When he accidentally kills Dina, his goal becomes keeping her safe in the afterlife, no matter the cost. Maybe when her parents turn out to still be alive, this goal could shift into revenge mode again? As in maybe [[Caleb]] focuses more on the future of how things will go with the Revenants while Scoop wants to enact vengeance on the once who caused it all to happen in the past and maybe to stop the "virus from spreading further" 
His journey could be about learning to value his own life and wellbeing, letting people into his life again and letting go of the past's mistakes?

Dinara starts off wanting to be herself, to be free and to be loved, to escape her family's grasp etc. 
After her death she wants to stay far away from her creepy stalker/killer and fully embrace the new found powers and freedom she has, she wants to become the person she believes she had to be. Maybe she could be the present to Caleb's future and Scoop's past. Maybe she's so excited to exist beyond what life had given her and subconsciously so happy to have power over herself now, that she doesn't even want to know about her life before (like an evasion trauma thing of "don't stirr what's at the bottom" ) because she's terrified by the nightmares and flashbacks and wants nothing to do with that. 
Maybe it's about her journey to accept the missed opportunities and mourning the life she never truly had, moving on and finally growing into herself, even if she is fully, irreversibly changed and even if most other people don't see her life as good or worth living anymore. Maybe it's about her finally finding her people and learning that she had always been enough, no matter what her parents said. I don't know what her story goal would be though, maybe just to keep her friend/S safe and by her side. Idk

[[Celia]] could be a very dark version of this loneliness and delusion. As in she is so disconnected from reality, she's only parasocially attached to people and doesn't know how to socialise without some sort of mask (like her marionette) she's what [[Dinara]] could have become if she were more cruel and selfish. But that's just my view, correct me on this pls


Ultimately you need to ask yourself for the story : What do they want and what gets in the way of them getting it
