[[A reason for Dinara's Looks]]

# Ideas


**Steak fork and steak Knife as cutlery hands**
- easier to draw
- steak reference and focus
- eat or be devoured mentality
- more viable as a weapon


**Also what if her mom, [[Zarina]] was always instilling in her mind that in this world it's "eat or be devoured" so the cutlery manifested as a subconscious desire to permanently break free from being prey**
