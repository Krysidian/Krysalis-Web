Maybe scoop didn't succeed killing the parents, only [[Dinara]] which immediately made him snap out of it. 
the parents still live under new names but he misremembers killing them. Only one day he finds out they still live and he needs to think about if it's worth pursuing them again.

Unreliable narrators: [[Scoop]] and later [[Dinara]] remember different events on that day. He thought her dad used her as a shield while she remembers trying to save her parents. He can't bear the thought of killing her and doesn't understand why she would save her parents despite everything
