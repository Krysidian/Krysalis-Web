## Ideas



> [!Warning] Outdated Idea
> Absent mother being a bleak look into what [[Dinara]] could've ended up as if she never broke free
"I'm you if you had seen that you could choose your path"/ "I'm you once you realise all of them lead to hell " #toBeChanged 


You could add a hint of jealousy from Dinas mom towards her. Resenting her for her youth, keeping her daughter insecure because of her own insecurities. That's what a lot of really horrible moms do

Maybe the mother is more active, ruthless and actively vile towards Dinara, while the dad is neglectful. The mother is professional business wise while the dad is violent and intense in that regard.
So the fly scene would play out with the mom. Since she has the highest standards. While the dad is quite careless and cold

They're both narcissists perfect for each other 
It's the "I can fix him? No, I can make him worse" meme



Okay so about the dynamic of [[Dinara|Dina]] and her mom: what if her mom was just firmly convinced that hardening her daughter was the one and only way to make her survive in this world? What if she thought she was too lax with [[Nadya]] and that's why she managed to escape, so now she plans out all these things for [[Dinara|Dina]] to so she always knows where her daughter is and that she's giving 200% in making sure 
she'll be prepared

[[Parents coping with Nadyas Disappearance]]

Yeah probably best to put it after her sister's "death", because her mom will be like "alright, the kiddy treatment ends now. Time fit cruelty"


[[Zarina]] - "Außerdem lässt sich der Name aus dem Altslawischen übersetzen, dort trägt er die Bedeutung "die Herrscherin", "die Königliche" und "die Zarin" in sich. Abgeleitet von dem altslawischen Wort tsar bzw. tzar (царь) für "der Herrscher"."

The second fly scene would probably be [[Dinara]] going through with it and killing the fly (which later springs back to life ) to avoid punishment, regretting it later 

Dinara basically dies right before her breaking point, before she gave in to the corruption.

What if her mom's nickname for [[Dinara|Dina]] was maggot
Or like, how she addresses her in disdain as in "Stop nagging me, you little maggot"
