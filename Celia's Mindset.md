Maybe [[Celia]]'s obsession with [[Dinara]] came from her being the reason why she'll become a Revenant

Her indulging in Dinara's wishes to only be in the present and to let go of the past is interesting. Like a "fuck everything, live now, no consequences" mindset vs a "I want to know my past so I can move forward into the now" type
