## Ideas



[[Dinara]] has some sort of accessory she wants to find because it has deeper meaning of her past.
Like a necklace. Dragonfly wings encased in Amber perhaps.
Since she feels like a fly without wings.



> [!Warning] Outdated Button Idea
> "What if she collects Buttons? Like before when she was attacked, maybe she realized that she had lost one and so she went out to get a sewing kit, heard that something was up in another toom, went into it and died. But at the back of her mind she subliminally remembers that she needs to get that last button"
> Maybe something in her brain can't let go of the fact that if she hadn't tried to fix the blouse, she wouldn't have died
> If you want to make it less convoluted, this could also be simplified down to her having lost one of her **earrings** and looking for it in the house. She hears the commotion before she finds it
Maybe she wears one earring and wants to find the other but her one ear is missing so it wouldn't make things right anyway. Just an itch that needs scratching, no real solution #toBeChanged 

Okay so I like the idea of [[Dinara|Dina]] having those fancy boring ass earrings she wears for show, to be like ah yes russian inheritance

But to wear a necklace that she got as a gift or bought for herself or something, because it's physically closer to her heart

And so it can either be a thing of like, she gets the second earring and accepts that there is no going back but she reclaims her past for herself, keeping it and wearing it as a pin or something. Or she could have the set finally completely and decide that this is not what she wanted after all, she doesn't want to go back anymore, so she throws them away

So we would have two important items in Dinara's life for two very different aspects of her prior life
And the way she deals with getting them back will symbolize how she'll move on from her past!

(My first thought was to have it be from Caleb, like on the night of the prom he could've given it to her in the fields, because maybe he had gotten it for a girl he liked but he dropped it and [[Dinara|Dina]] picked it up, so he kept trying to get to her all evening to explain the situation. And when he finally catches up with her, they talk and he decides to let her keep it because he can tell how lonely she is)


Jackets are like the ultimate thing to give someone
The third keepsake is from Caleb, representing present or future. A very personal gift

The one to give [[Dinara|Dina]] her first keepsake perhaps was an older sister, [[Nadya]]? who died when she was very young #toBeChanged
