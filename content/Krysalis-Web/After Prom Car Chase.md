Something I just remembered .I had this vague idea in my head, mainly just because of random images I got in my head while listening to something: 
Maybe the events that lead to Scoops eventual death happened shortly after the prom night since it was some kind of setup.
He was tasked with looking after her and taking her home so he wasn't prepared for combat and it would be the last situation where he would expect an assault from the very people he works for, whose daughter would be in the same car. 
But the Dad would simply put his trust in his other best guys, knows that Scoop isn't the guy to take her as a hostage to save his life and basically gambles one his own daughters life, just to take out a man he considers unreliable and very loose and dangerous.
