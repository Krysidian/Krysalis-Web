Niceeeee. 
I think I like the idea of [[Dinara|Dina]] feeling drawn to cute, sorta childish things because she never got to have that post age 5 (I can imagine her mom forcing her to wear formal attire as soon as she started going to school/when [[Nadya]] left)

So maybe she'd find like silly retro patches and pins or print shirts with cartoon characters on them and keep those. Or (inspired by the Record player song) she could have a weird attachment to vintage dresses, which could also make for an interesting aesthetic if she tried it out.

The clash between the past and present being mirrored in her style, a desire to return to what's lost and also just a funny choice for a zombie to dress cute
