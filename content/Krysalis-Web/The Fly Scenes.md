Two Fly Scenes mirroring each other. One after [[Nadya]]'s disappearance and one shortly before [[Dinara]] dies.


> [!Warning] Outdated Idea
> Like maybe with her dad talking to her and being a jerk, ending the argument by crushing a fly to death to intimidate her, while [[Dinara|Dina]] just whinces. As she leaves and he turns away, the fly comes back to life
> 
> That's a super gross idea but what if he wipes the dead fly off on her shirt. Like to show that not only is he prepared to do the dirty work to keep the business going, even if she's still too "weak", but he also doesn't care how uncomfortable it makes her and eventually she'll have to go down his path
> Or he even grabs her hand and smashes the fly with it. Using it to hurt, scare and disgust her. Pushing her past her limits



For the fly scene: Flies are hard af to catch, so what if it starts off with [[Dinara|Dina]] seeing a fly trapped in the room, taking a glass to collect it with the intention of taking it outside to release it, but then her mom comes in with business stuff to do and barks at [[Dinara|Dina]] to leave it and fuck off. [[Dinara|Dina]] leaves the room. 

She re-enters the room a bit later, at least a few hours, to talk to her mom again. In horror she sees that her mother never put the fly outside. It weakly pounds against the glass in despair during the entire scene. The Argument™ commences and the fly serves as a visual metaphor for Dinas emotional state. As the scene progresses, her mother gets more and more agitated, lamenting about her daughter's inability to be more capable. Her mother gets closer, finally taking her hand so aggressively that for a second [[Dinara|Dina]] flinches, expecting a slap. Her mother growls at her, how [[Dinara|Dina]] has had it so easy, she's had everything she ever needed at her fingertips and she has wasted all of it. [[Dinara|Dina]] struggles to free herself from her mother's grasp, bumping against the table and making the glass fall over 

"Please, I didn't mean to hurt you!" 

(maybe it shatters? Makes for a good break in the scene, snaps the characters out of the tension for a second? Maybe out of place in this moment but worth considering) the fly is too weak at this point to fly much, it just buzzes on the table. 

"Hurt me?" 

Her mother looks down at it in disgust, before slamming down Dinas hand onto it.

"You disgust me"


That's a really cool scene! I like the glass aspect as well, with the fly getting weaker. 
When I first thought about the scene I just imagined it being some kind of twisted lesson after the mother grows agitated. About commitment, patience or something like that. A bitter and cold scolding. Where she grabs Dinaras arm forcefully and slowly moves her hand over the fly, explaining what [[Dinara]] has to do and that she has to do it slowly and methodically so the fly doesn't notice until it's too late. "They see the world slower, differently. And we can use that to our advantage" Or something like that. So the fly dying would be very intentional and cold. 
But I love your version of it a lot with the glass shattering and buildup! And where we see the fly gradually get weaker and stay trapped ^^  Maybe it can be combined in some ways

And if you keep the lines of dialogue, it would be interesting to have Dina's emotions rise throughout the scene, getting more and more panicked while her mom does a 180 and is entirely calm by the end


Instead it could be interesting to have something like (before the fly is crushed) "You tarnish the family name with your cowardice." "I didn't mean to make you angry, I'm sorry!" *glass falls, her mom freezes and her face shifts to blank * "You couldn't if you tried."

(implication of how her mom's a huge control freak and she can't stand the thought of anyone "manipulating" her or her emotions)

I think it could be interesting to have this scene take place somewhere in the past, when [[Dinara|Dina]] is still a teenager or even a child

Like [[Dinara|Dina]] already went through this traumatic moment and at some point something similar happens but this time the fly comes back
