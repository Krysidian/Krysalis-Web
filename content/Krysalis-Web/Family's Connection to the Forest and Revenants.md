I like the idea that the revenant ground zero really is at the heart of the family and at least partially intentional. They weren't fully aware of how it works and thought it would simply increase life span and strengthen you instead of turning you undead. And [[Dinara]] was kind of the family "backup" at first, the parents maybe wanting to eventually use the serum on their offspring eventually. But the revenant "plague" spreading that early and fast may have not been as intentional and the stuff kinda leaked onto the market at some point
