## What I did Today


--- 
## Ideas
> Everywhere I go, every Revenant I meet, I see a shadow of someone who truly lived once, and could call themselves human. Now they're just desperately trying to escape what they've become. No-one truly embraces being undead cause they know what it implies
> Being a [[Revenants|Revenant]] means you're defined by failure.




>Going through the gates of hell? Nah, I'm just holding the door open.
