## Ideas

Tornadoes that form in specific areas of the [[Mushroom Forest]]. Since Mushrooms seem to be able to somewhat control the weather using their spores maybe there are areas where extreme weather conditions only exist because of the forest nearby. Perhaps these tornadoes serve some kind of purpose.

Maybe there are specially trained people that use remote devices like drones to check out the tornadoes and keep an eye on them.
