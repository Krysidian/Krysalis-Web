## What I did Today

Had a weird dream about school again. Basically just some kind of normal classes going on, but for ex. Liat was actually there and I was confused when I told her I'm glad she's back and she said she never left.
I felt a dreadful sense of guilt.
When the day was over I went to the parking lot to find my mom who would drive me home but the parking lot was so sprawling and huge. Though interestingly quite accurate in the layout. People were also outside talking, even celebrating (Talking about Better Call Saul which made me excited, since I just watched it. Also why it just randomly came up). 
I couldn't find her and started to worry. I even went to Tim's car which was quite big since apparently he had his own car and was about to leave. I walked multiple rounds trying to find her but it turns out she was just opposite of Tim's car but I was too blind to see it. Everything else played out rather normal, though my emotions were really bittersweet. #dream
