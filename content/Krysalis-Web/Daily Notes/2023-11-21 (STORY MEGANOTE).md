[[Dinara Design Notes]]



[[Dinara's Amber Pendant]]

calls herself maggot after reviving cause she remembers hearing it constntly caujse her mother called her that 
learns name through caleb
called "little one" by her sis

Scoop drives against tree after driving away with Dinara and leaves her there. after the deal comes back to see her awaken already


Scoop meets the plague doctor shortly after dying? But scoop already lost his body and doesn't want to lose his soul as well.

Maybe the doctor always meets someone shortyl after dying but later gets so busy wiht everyone turning that they only get a letter from the doctor to either meet up or do the deal remotely 
"Subscription models from the devil"

Scoop hastily switches the crystal after noticing hers being damaged. and then notices  the doctor slowly approaching, hastily switches it and makes the "deal"


"Stay close to him!"


She wants to confront him shortly after reviving and he lashes out cause it's too much, scaring her. 

His distance to his crystal is dependent on his energy, max 500-1000m



Maybe [[CELIA]], supports and manipulates [[Caleb]] by giving info  (maybe the final info) 



[[Celia]] (My[[Celia]])

Searchparty in the city? - why do they know where to search? 

Maybe they're near the city not directly in it after the boat. The dressup happens inbetween. 


FUNKLOCH/Dead Zone? The city arc is the first time caleb has a connection again. 

Someone recognizes the wanted poster, Caleb is confused. 


Dinara looking different after the dressup too in order to not be noticed as quickly. Celia does not yet know if the person caleb's with is actually her and goes to the city to find out.


Scoop, decides to save Caleb, probably using the revenant that Dinara fought (in the fight where she hurt Caleb on accident) and uses the Desmocore to protect Caleb. Putting it into the Scarf he wears. 

The revenants 

Chase before search meetup

Dude who's camping drags dinara and caleb out. (A human, probably a woman who was interested in revenants like caleb but wants out now. Like a warning for caleb) 
Does not see them as a danger and is intrigued my Dinara
~~Knows about the searchparty? recognizes Dinara after a while.~~
next day it's a searchparty 


Searchparty goes from the city to outside. And when caleb goes online celias plans change and get easier



Caleb gets hunted by the PUPPET while Celia talks with Dinara



Scoop *reluctantly* saves caleb. Maybe it's not the Puppet trying to kill Caleb 



**Why and how does Dinara's and Celia's first conversation end?** 


Maybe Caleb sends a note during EVICTION, it doesn't go through,
and it goes through afterwards.

**Missing posters turn into wanted posters in a way**


What is Scoop's connection with Celia?

Chase scene makes them split up. Chases them because Caleb is using his phone


Maybe they split after Dinara finds out about scoops plot twist (and is upset)

Dinara and scoop joking about eating caleb at some point

Scoop has a very dry humor


Dinara losing her body parts during the very bad bad day, where Scoop may also meet Namida 



A moment where dinara shows off new abilities and stuff but Caleb just slowly drifts into grief as he realizes that Dinara has changed forever and he truly was to late when it comes to "making her human again", turning her back. She really died and is someone else now. And he has to come clean with that.



Caleb asking to inspect Dinara's Revenant parts out (he's a biologist)

Celia kind of a cyberbully and doing fake news.


Maybe the parents wanted to destroy the forest to take control? Celia ain't having that.

Zarina the face of the operation wanting to destroy it all

Celia about to lose everything.

Thinks that Dinara killed her parents and "saved" all revenants. 
Even worse when she finds out that Dinara actually died *saving* her parents. Celia can't live with that. 

Caleb getting hurt with a mind game revenant (immitating sounds that are familiar)
maybe a shifting house, claustrophobic.

maybe Celia giving sensible information to that revenant. 

**Scoop learning to live for himself, not sacrificing himself constantly**

Maybe the mother survives and hires the bartender to find Scoop and Dinara.
Because she wants revenge as well or because she wants Dinara back, as she can't lose her investment




Dinara cutting and styling her hair shortly before the prom. Having long, boring hair before

Blade legs could represent the shears she used to cut her hair. 

Scoop buys  ice cream right before meeting Dinara to cheer her up (two ice creams cause he doenst know what she likes, one waffle ice one with a spoon)  Spoon being the last thing he kept in his pocket before being captured 

Maybe scoop gives her an ice cream with the same flavor in a later scene with caleb but she picks the other one saying she never like the previous but loved the gesture

Both ice creams are cup ice cream, she chooses one the other is in the cup holder for now and never gets eaten by scoop (Vanilla + Strawberry) Scoop chooses strawberry (red)
Maybe Dinara chooses vanilla cause she has a bright dress and doesn't want to make visible stains (fears her parents)

Strawberry ice spilling representing blood, getting on her dress as the car drives into the ditch.


Scoop seeing his frined caputure him is confusing at first, maybe he asks scoop a personal question that exists to see if Scoop bertrayed the family. (wanting to know the truth) 

Maybe dinara chases general directoin and later goes to that direction again later on to investigate.
ALso the parents dont care which appalls dinara 

Maybe Dinara hears the shot that kills scoop, thinks its hunting season, crows flying, a dead deer? an almost dead deer? an undead deer? 


Hit on Scoop done by Lev (turns out a lot more clumsy)


Potential Triad Friend names: Mordecai, Monroe, **Morel**, Montain, montero (monaghan as a surname)

The scene where Morel and Lev? shoot scoop, he has the choice to look one of them in the face, its morel

Maybe Scoop get's tainted with fake rumors etc. for Morel to convince him a bit


Name suggestsion: Malvina, shortform: Vinny

Regarding Scoop's girlfriend: 
What if she didn't die a horribly violent death, what if she heard of what had happened between her boyfriends and decided to remove herself from the situation by moving into the woods and dying on her own terms


Dinara keeps the gun that Scoop gave her after the car chase:

Yo what if after the carchase Dinara keeps the gun in secret, hiding it in her room and taking it with her when she goes out to look for Scoop. After the stag incident she stops going there out of fear but keeps the weapon.
On the day she dies, she hears an avid argument going on downstairs and takes the gun with her because she fears it's a burglar. But when she recognises Scoop's voice, she leaves the gun in the hallway, figuratively and literally lowering her guard



Why Morel betrayed Scoop

If we follow the theme of people doing terrible things for love, maybe Morell betrayed Scoop not only to save his family but to save their girlfriend as well. Maybe Dinara's parents were legit leveraging everything against Morell to do this and maybe he didn't even know this would end in killing his partner. Maybe he was told that they just needed information but then Zarina kept pushing and pushing, eventually daring Morell to shoot or he'd be seen as complicit in Scoop's case. What if Morell can't take the pain that comes from having done this and considers or actually commits suicide, so that when Scoop comes to kill him, he's already gone

Alternatively what if when Scoop gets to him, he doesn't fight back. Before he recognises Scoop, he tries to get his gun, but aiming at the mysterious figure, he realises who it is. Maybe he tries to run and reason, to apologise or beg for his life. Of maybe he just lowers his gun and stares into the eyes of the man he killed as he pulls the trigger

Scoop enacts his revenge the way he was killed. Two shots to the head

I like to imagine that Scoop shoots each of his targets twice, in the same vein as he was killed and only uses a gun for those on his hitlist before fighting mainly with the spoon. That way he has more control and won't kill on accident again. 
Also what if he does hit Zarina but the shot isn't lethal and the second shot hits Dinara which is what snaps him out of it.

Alsoooo how many people are on that hitlist? Because I think it could be more interesting to have it "ramp up", aka start with the least horrible person and end with Zarina and Lev, with Morell being the one before it, as it's the most personal.

Alternatively, what if he meant to kill Morell last and the fact that he accidentally kills Dinara is what stops this revenge quest from being fully finished. That way Morell could still play an active part in the main story

That's such a cool idea. Also great cause it gives him a signature that would probably give him notoriety. Like the case of the "double shot murders" 
how about: The twin shot killer

Maybe he shoots twice, one shot hits Lev and is lethal but the second one gets stopped by Dinara. Or he kills lev first completely and wants to do the same thing to Zarina but then like you said, the second shot gets Dinara




That's roughly what the old beartrap revenant idea represented back then. His head gone together with his humanity, replaced with the last thing he did. The thing thing that Scoop stepped into: a trap
Like a last act of forgiveness, Scoop having grown enough as a person to recognise that this isn't right. And that despite the horror he's been through because of Morell, his past lover doesn't deserve to spend his afterlife like this

Exactly! A situation in which you could question if what he did was out of revenge or mercy but more points would lead to the conclusion that Scoop didn't feel malice, but pity and even compassion and just wanted to finally lay it to rest.

Also I had the idea of Dinara coming home very late after prom to her parents fighting, she's still in shock, her dress is stained red from the ice cream (maybe change it to Cherry instead of Strawberry, that makes the color more bloody) her shoes are muddy and sore, she hides the gun in the garden and goes inside. Her mother's first reaction is to yell at her because of what she's done to her hair. Dinara is too surprised to speak, Zarina pulls her inside and barks at her, saying she looks awful and what was she thinking, ruining the dress as well. Dinara begins to explain what had happened with Scoop but her mom cuts her off, saying "He flunked out on you, we know", gaslighting Dinara into thinking he left her instead of what had really happened

Also what if for a second when her mom opens the door, she actually looks concerned and goes to cup Dina's face with her hands but then immediately goes back to being furious when she notices her hair

I also had the thought of Dinara maybe sneaking some dinner off of her plate and to her room to feed birds from her windowsill when she was grounded, so she'd have some kind of company but the birds could sense that there was something off and never came too close to the house. So the food rotted away on the windowsill and when the flies came, Dina would sit at the window and observe them with fascination

Also if Dina has long blonde hair that obscures her face it almost works as a Rapunzel reference, if she doesn't get to leave the house often XD

Can we have Dina call her metal fly Simon? I would love to immortalise him
Although my mom always thought I called him "Salmon/Salomon" because at six years old my English pronunciation was apparently shit XD

Maybe Dina remembers putting the leftovers of a salmon meal in hopes to attract something but just one fly came xD





Caleb learning about Dinara's daily difficulties in life:

I imagine him being a little disgusted by her in the beginning, because even if she doesn't sweat, her clothes probably smell pretty gross. She's agitated at that, because she knows how much effort it takes to change clothes frequently 

Then at the makeover scene he catches her, trying her hardest to put something on but struggling, so he offers his help and she reluctantly agrees to save time but is clearly very uncomfortable with admitting to needing support

Then later when he's awake and more stable after the soup scene, he notices the cut on her leg and asks if he can help her with that. She feels so guilty, she doesn't want him to get close to her but he says something about how it hurts him to see her hurt so she agrees, letting him disinfect and patch up the wound. She leans against him a little as he does it, subconsciously seeking confirmation that he really is still alive, he's okay, he forgave her and she didn't kill him.

So when they have to dress up to go back into human society, he just asks if she needs a hand, she rolls her eye and then he helps her without it being too odd for them anymore

The ending of this one gave me the idea that it could be interesting to show the part of Scoop's backstory where he dies after we see him confront and kill the Revenant version of Morell, so at first it's a little puzzling to have this skilled killer be so careful in the way he kills this one. And to have Scoop be fighting his emotions throughout the entire thing, remarking to the others that he knew the guy (which is an odd statement to an outsider because here's this feral thing without a head that Scoop is acting differently around, but that's how it is with past lovers. There's certain things you don't forget and certain feelings you keep forever)


Morell's thoughts on killing himself: "Day after day I waited. For you to return, to kill me like you should have. But you never came. So I thought I'd join you."

Morell wanted to see Scoop again so desperately, he would've died if only it was Scoop's face he saw last



Security cameras in Dinaras house, constantly surveilled but never seen.

Morels name being Dorian Morel 

The Prom dress is pastel turquoise 

Namida and Scoops girlfirend having one last conversation before she decides to go on her own terms. 



Her name being Cassidy, Cassidy Jane 



Cassidy leaving behind information before she dies, that scoop eventually finds but cannot find the strength to read and has to eventually ask dinara to read it and maybe analyze it. 
Making them work together beyond death and time

Maybe the information leads them back to dinara's old home. 


Maybe the Zarinas deal weakened Dinaras crystal as part of the plan

Miasma is aware of Scoops trick and uses it as an opportunity. Dinara only living cause Miasma finds interest even amusement in the whole ordeal. 




(Dinara wanting to trade back her crystal at some point, splitting off from the rest, giving Scoop back his crystal)



Potential Ideas considering Namida in the story:

Okay two ideas: Celia is convinced that Dina killed her mom because she hacked into her phone and the last message sent was by Scoop who in his panic maybe texted someone they both knew "I killed her", Celia thinks it's about Zarina, when it's really about Dinara Second idea: Dinara was given biological access to something connected with her parents' shady business stuff, so if anything ever happened to them, she could take over. So a certain code plus her blood or her fingerprints can open a certain thing/secret room/ secret files/ whatever with info and instructions. All this mixed with enough material to pressure Dinara into doing what they want her to continue by framing her as an accomplice and making it impossible to leave Cassidy finds out about this and collects the first code after a long and risky search. She then begins to write letters/record her voice with instructions on how Dinara can access and use that for good/ to reveal it to the public that her parents were doing evil shit and she isn't part of it. After Cassidy runs out of things to say, she takes her final payment (the drug she'll overdose on) retreats into the cabin and asks Namida to find Dinara and give her the recordings. Namida can't get themselves to do it, because hearing Cassidy's voice is what keeps them from slipping too much into Scour-mode and grounds them. In the cabin they find Cassidy's diary before her death and Scoop can't get himself to read it. Dinara takes over for him and notices the line "I hope Namida delivered the message. The kid deserves better than this." which makes them suspicious, they go out and search for Namida and fight/convince them to get the recordings


Oh! Also! If Dinara's fingerprints are required to open the thing then it adds a new obstacle to overcome and a bump in the storyflow. It could be solved by getting the gun back which is the last thing her hands have touched and scanning that? I don't know how this stuff works but I love it when characters get something only to run against the wall again. It tests them and adds suspense



**Celia stealing the gun?**



Dinara psychological torment with people mocking her on the internet leading up to Finding out her sister just left her. 

1. Morozov




Dinara's theme could be a piano that starts with lots of notes and energy that reduces over time and ends with the leitmotif of just one note after another. 

Maybe an abandoned piano where she tries to play with an old piano and Caleb may want to help her play.

Bringing her back to piano lessons where she still had fun as a small kid, maybe even having a friend that she lost after losing 


Morell becoming the new bodyguard for Zarina after Cassidy and maybe being the one taking the gun

being shocked about Scoop



Calebs wound is probably going through him and would be lethal so those bandages have to heal him which would give him unforeseen mental aftereffects. He's hallucinating and probably confused when hes fed soup, thinking its a dream. Also kinda uncomfortable since he couldn't consent to something so dangerous
Dinara is wrought with guilt because of this but also doesn't want him to deal with it alone


Cassidy means the one with curly hair, what if she starts off with curls but as her illness gets worse, she can't take care of it as well any longer so it gets more flat






Morell is writing the text about the parents death instead of scoop


The barkeeper blames herself a bit for fueling scoops revenge by helping him disable the cameras at home(giving him the info to do it) and that makes her turn to help morell in the end. Later perhaps working with Zarina and even Celia

She'd be well versed in Hacking and probably got the blueprints to some of morells traps

Maybe she tells scoop that cassidy has died.

She also tells morell later that scoops alive thinking it would lift him up but it just causes a mental breakdown. She involuntarily causes the events of the revenge arc.



Morells crystal on in one of his hands, being wreckless self destructive and wanting to die, showing where his weakness is. The hand having sentimental value with scoop




I had an idea earlier; what if the Bartender and Zarina used to know each other and work together when they were younger? What if Zarina was a hired killer too before she married Lev and realised that with certain business stuff you can get more money (and kill more people I guess akdmsmsm)
So when BT finds the lost earring in her bar, she already knows that trouble is coming her way



scoopening 

About how Scoop asks Dinara to cut onions to keep her busy and to remind her that she can make something good, her hands aren't just made for killing (maybe as he had realised himself, many years ago before everything went to shit) but it's too soon and what has worked for him, is making her spiral. His hidden act of deeply caring about her goes awfully wrong, because they simply aren't at that place yet where it could ever go right

Or Caleb, waking up from his delirium, muttering "I had a nightmare you tried to kill me", Dinara answering it wasn't a dream, she really had stabbed him and him saying "No, not on purpose" because he already knows she didn't mean to and he already forgave her, while she will carry this guilt for a while longer

One option for when Dinara asks "Then why did you kill me, Seamus?": he freezes or flinches, because it's been a while since he's been called that and the memory of the life he once had hurts too much to comprehend, so the words that leave his mouth before he can stop them are "Don't call me that." Dinara's face grows grim and angry "Is that a threat?" but goes back to confused when he answers "It's a request." he looks her straight in the eyes for once and she suddenly doesn't feel like fighting anymore "Please." he adds and she doesn't object



I just listened to Dead but Pretty by IC3PEAK and imagined that for Dina's funeral scene, maybe her mom had this elaborate rose garden that she was very invested in (ala Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland) and that Dina was never allowed to get near (really it served to make sure she stayed in the garden and didn't flee, as the thorns would make that difficult) so when she buries her old life, she cuts down as many of the roses as she can, placing them on her own grave. Showing she is done with being caged in and ordered around

And maybe she used to have scars on her shins from when she tried to run away as a child, but now when she returns, she literally uses her legs to cut down the roses

"God damn your face, Dorian Morell"









Wouldn't it be interesting to have the Triad all share the same intrinsic belief leading them to an entirely different conclusion?
Like, maybe Cassidy believes "I'm worthless, but I will do all I can to prove myself worthy, even if it kills me", while Scoop believes "I'm worthless, therefore I must do all I can to help those who are worth the effort" and Morell believes "I'm worthless, so there's no point in trying to change that"











One of scoops mantras being "Everyone is useful" recontextualized later to rather fit "Everyone has their uses" where he takes the idea to the extreme, shown by him using the crystals and parts of previous revenants as ingredients etc.








There will be a moment where Dinara get's Memories implanted into her mind by some other evil force (Revenant) that are supposedly fabricated and with the purpose to break her spirit. Everyone she cared about calling her names and hating her. The memory involving  [[Nadya]] would be the worst.

It would make her uncomfortable for way longer than all the other memories cause deep down she's convinced it's an authentic memory. But she tries everything to dismiss it because in her mind the only family she thought she had was her sister and if those words are true than she'd have noone in the past.

It could be open to interpretation if what Nadya said was intentional, to make Dinara hate her and therefore process her "disappearance" better rather than honest words. Both should be a possibility (Note to self: think about Pelafina in House of Leaves and her behavior or the last argument Jimmy and his brother Chuck have in Better Call Saul)



Wetwork <-> Waterworks




Scene where Celia talks with her puppet revenant and it oddly enough seems like a real conversation making you wonder if the puppet actually has a personality on his own only to reveal that he's wearing the glasses that control him the entire time. Celia is just having a very diverse inner monologue that she externalized through him. Basically turning him into an imaginary friend you have in your head. With their own character quirks and differences, but clearly just an extension of your mind, not an actual different person. She simply can't form relationships with anyone other than herself even if she tries.







A conversation between Dinara and Scoop where he reminisces over his past with his only friends and the fact that meeting them, especially Cassidy was completely luck. At which point Dinara would cut him off and suggest "Misfortune" instead. Obviously a statement that cuts him more than he expected but he also can't find a rebuttal as he looks at her and remembers the terrible events that the triad directly and indirectly caused, causing suffering especially for Dinara 




"You got the worst job for having a family, you were perfect for it. And still, you chose a new one."




Morell feeling like a resource all his life which led him to desire a strong and independent personality (similar to Dinara in that sense) but his sense of duty (for the children in his leftover family) and loved ones led him back on the path of being a tool. In this case a weapon for the mafia




A post betrayal scene of Morell "socializing" or pretending to in some kind of social meetup (bar or party) and after receiving a complement about his looks and or charisma he drops his demeanor to an almost blank slate instead of taking the complement with pride like he used to. As if guilt had completely overridden every emotion for a split second and completely brought him out of the usual spiel he was able to pull off effortlessly. That complement not only reminded him of the past but also reflected his own shattered self image onto him. 








Maybe a small Morell centric scene after his mental state already worsened. 
Maybe having to interact with some civilians, telling them to leave the place or something but one refuses.
clearly anxious but still determined that regular person stands up for himself and calls morell out for being a cold blooded murderer for hire. And that no matter what he'll never show him respect.
Dorian will brush it off, scoff at him, call him a hypocrite that lives because of said murderers. He'll show his usual bravado, wide smile and dismissive talk but it's clear that this is cutting deep and he feels offended. Cause he's inclined to agree. But he doesn't want to hear it from someone else.




Storm chasing being a more prominent job and hobby due to the frequent storms and the potential rewards that can be reaped. maybe there is legal and illegal chasing, the illegal variant is done in order to get specific resources only available near and during the storm, that's normally regulated and harvested by companies with big machinery. Maybe it's special mycelia that gets ripped up and thrown into the air that can be used for specific technology. Used to create illegal and unregulated technology like weaponry and is considered contraband
