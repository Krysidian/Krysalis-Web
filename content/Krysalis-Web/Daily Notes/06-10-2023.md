## What I did Today


--- 
## Ideas

the [[Special Bandages with anomalous properties]] can have different Properties
mainly used for healing and restoring the body
Maybe some can be used to "reinforce" and glue together the body of a revenant, making the body more resilient. It does that by somewhat binding the matter to the bandages. So that body part wrapped in it is bound to it. 
Maybe someone would use that to bind and trap characters like [[Scoop]] someday. Like decapitating him, wrapping his head in the bandages and then taking that as far away as possible 
(inspired by the prison realm sealing and that scene in Fire Punch where Agni's head gets wrapped in fire resistant wrappings)
