## Ideas

>There are people in this world who go about demanding to be killed. You must have noticed them. They quarrel in gambling games. They jump out of their automobiles in a rage. They humiliate and bully people whose capabilities they do not know. These are people who wander through the world shouting, "kill me". And there's always someone ready to oblige to them.

Don Corleone, The Godfather #quote


"Ah yes pride, the one thing you hold onto when you know you've lost."
