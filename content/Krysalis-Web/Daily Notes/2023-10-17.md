## Ideas

Companies are probably the closest thing to actual real demons or devils in the real world. They are a larger than life, beyond human organism with complete und utter lack of humanity or soul. Just a husk imitating what a human might be or how one might act for personal profit. Yet it is born from real people. Sometimes even with good intentions at first. That quickly corrupt into greed. 
They act like one combined being that can change it's appearance and face whenever it wants to in order to trick it's prey.
And yet we live together with them and are dependent on them. Might look and feel like symbiosis at first but it's actually just a parasitic relationship. Every time, every exchange is a deal with the devil, a bargain you choose or feel forced to choose to live in this world. But almost every bargain is a monkey's paw, has a catch that silently bleeds you dry. 
And often you're aware of it's parasitic nature yet still feel inclined to give in, simply because it sold you the reality that there is no other alternative, and it offers the only solution to your problem. If you like it or not.
