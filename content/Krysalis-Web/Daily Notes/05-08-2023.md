## What I did Today

## Ideas

- maybe two [[Revenants]] that basically switched each other's facial skin in a grotesque way, as if they were wearing masks. If the Revenant that has the body talks, the entire mouth moves and jaw opens, if only the skin mask moves, the other one is talking. That way both can communicate over longer distances.
