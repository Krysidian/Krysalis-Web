## Ideas


- Watching and remembering someone through video will accentuate the repetitive and looping nature over time, the fa√ßade will slip
- But you can argue that a person is nothing more than a long movie. It ends at some point and you won't develop and change for all infinity. So I don't think seeking someone in videos is a hollow comfort. There will always be a barrier between you and the other and a video projection of someone is simply a bigger barrier to cross. It's still something worth holding onto #concept
