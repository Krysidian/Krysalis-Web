## Ideas


scoop was part of a hitman group as his main job. All of them do it for a different reason, some more sadistic and self serving than others. Some think it's a noble deed or justice.
And one of them would probably simply think: "we're all doing the exact same thing, so reasons don't matter anyway. No point in Morals" [[Scoop]]
