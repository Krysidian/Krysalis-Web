## Ideas

"Concealed" [[Scours]] or just "The Concealed" are Scours that do not have discernable facial features like the regular grimace and gaping eye sockets. They may have a completely smooth surface, or weird anomalous growths. 
How and why they have these facial deformations is something I still have to explore but it could also be something influenced by the character aspects of the scour along with other external factors
