# Random Ideas




World Building

```
where does magic come from? - Common? Rare? Hidden?
what is fantastical?
time, place, advancement
gods, religion, beliefs
Races/Species
who is in power
what are threats

```

apparently murderers put on two sets of gloves since putting on the first set can leave finger prints on them so you cover it up with another pair.

Lifeforms with a core can be put into the categories Idiomorph (scour, revenants etc.) and Xenomorph/Allotriomorphs (unknown, more unstable lifeforms like the golems)


when someone becomes a revenant by themselves INTENT will determine their power and personality of their new selves quite a bit.

Revenants converted by others inherit their INTENT if they have any

Unwilling Revenants without INTENT are unhinged and directionless.

[[an anonymous world where you never amount to much]]

Some Revenants relearn to emulate their bodily functions and can therefore produce body heat etc. therefore looking like an average human.


Maybe prolonged eye contact between two or involving a revenant can lead to some unforeseen consequences? Slight, direct exchange of consciousness?


> Why are we, as people, so self destructive?

> I would rather suffer a lifetime than to die.





Character design inspired by the Guiro Rasp (Wooden Frog Instrument)


"Honesty will get you nowhere in life. Unless it's a threat. Never bluff. Always make sure they are dead certain on what's coming to them."



## Really Random Thoughts

“He always wore this specific shirt, like a cartoon character. Now noone will ever wear it again.”

It’s only now I truly realize, I wasn’t actually in love with you. I was just alone. And you were the first and only person that came to me whf

Company or product names can be pretty stupid some times and if they’re popular they can become words that will be used in everyday language. So maybe a really stupid funny program/program exists in my universe. Something like a Radiowave deciphering tool called FRED. (Frequency Radio Electronic Device) And doing something and creating something within it is called fredding (as if someone with a heavy german accent wants to say threading)

The Algiz symbol can also be called crow’s feet, which is also the name for the wrinkles around the eye

Chiropracter that heals people with martial arts, i guess

A secret market of Dads, from Dads, for Dads. Where secret _Dad Intel_ is being discussed. Highly insular and powerful. _The Dad Market_

Tinnitus turns into morse code

In the end, everything is a two-sided coin. It’s just up to the person to decide which one weighs more.


What kinds of clothes will I die in?

The Universe is a fractal.

The future already exists, I just have to wait.

DONT look into a mirror while dreaming (thanks [Jerma](http://twitch.tv/jerma985))

epic epical epicallistic epicallisticful epicallisticfullness epicallisticfullnessly

What's the difference between hope and struggle? Maybe that hope has expectations. You struggle when you don't think you can make it.




SCOOP DELECT DELISH





### Random Fight Scene Idea

A monumental fight where time stops right before the fatal blow against the villain, showing that he surrendered in defeat and died before the impact even hit him



### short comic strip prompts

**RELATABLE ARTIST COMIC**

Character doing lineart for a sketch

Arm shakes and vibrates violently in a overblown manner - outcome is to be expected

"Why am I like this" "Look how you massacred my boy"

some goon: _calls Dinara a maggot in a derogatory sense_

Dinara: aw cmon man, that's a low blow dude

character watches video or something and thinks an awful pun to themselves. They turn to look at their actual thought/speech-bubble in disgust and remark how unfunny they are



### Outdated?

A symbiote mini-hivemind that took over the body of a nearby farmer. Codename "DECAY". It's an autonomous drone with the purpose of purging unnatural life. (Life that refuses to eventually become "compost") What that means is supposed to be vague but it refers to the immortal revenants that made a deal. Though Dinara will think it wants to get rid of all revenants.

When the duo first meet it, it claims that it has no interest in the surveillant (Scoop) since his clock is already ticking. Both will think that it knows about the literal ticking time until Miasma will come and kill the surveillant (in Dinara's eyes, not knowing that she is the one with the deal) In reality the symbiote simply knows that Surveillant is simply a normal revenant. It actually wants to kill Dinara.

But at first sight it will seem like the reversal - wanting to kill Dinara since she is a normal scour and leaving the Sybarite since he has Miasma ending him eventually.

DECAY will look like a heavy-weighted middle-aged man with a long red beard, a charismatic smile and a somewhat unbuttoned flower shirt. He wears a large straw hat. It can throw said hat like a razor. The straw will turn into a net-like symbiote fiber that can move autonomously.

Its real form is more lanky, the hat looking like a flower petal and part of the head.



### Magic Types

Magicka - Arcane, Illusinary, Aura, Manipulation, Elemental

> "If you are able to have the energy to hate so many things and people in life, you probably have too much time on your hands. I'm too tired to be spiteful now"

Boredom can be the catalyst for many terrible things. People flee into fantasy, desiring its replacement with the real world. Delusions build up in which they cannot tell them apart anymore. Simply because they do not want to.


### Writing Prompt Idea

Story told with "stock images". Like a comic but with a stock vibe to it. The watermark of the "company" becomes an actual object/presence of the story and is the main aspect of it. Inspired by Timotainment

Man googles himself, finds a wiki page about him with authentic info but also concerning events that haven't happended yet or didn't happen



### Game Idea





Connection between Sourire (Flood) and Amplitude (Sound) Since sound can be much louder underwater (Over 190 decibals)

> You burn down a dead forest in order to let a new one grow.





You cannot break my body for it is not my own. You will only scratch the surface. Someone else's surface. Because you can't dig deeper where there is nothing but absence beyond your view.


### The dead man's switch

2 sided metallic scour: the cold and ruthless personality is something/one from another timeline instance and thus unpredictable to Scorle. This is hidden information!!!

> "Succumb, coalesce and rejoice."

> "The universe has gained conciousness, meaning that it can think and interpret. This allows people like me to manipulate it's way of "thinking". I am reaching into the universal unconscious. That's why memetics and gesture can influence reality. I made it "interpret" my ideas. I communicate with it."

### lol

Possible name for the divinity: META Edit: NOT ANYMORE, thanks facebook

> "[...] Believe me, I seriously wouldn't wish this upon anybody. But you, you are not "anybody". You are noone. And your supposed legacy will be left to rot away. You will be forgotten. Well, the hundreds of people you have tormented and scarred may remember your face. But you are nothing but a monster to them. Mindless and slain. You will be, no, you have always been a nobody. A cipher's ashes and the decrepid shed he burned down with - just the same."


### Varrie’s Umbrella

Varrie's Umbrella is white on the inside and she uses it for softening light etc. since she is a total photo/filmography nerd.

Her stunted emotional capabilities and lack of true empathy beyond enjoying other’s having fun leads to her obsession with movies and stories. Especially tragic and grim one’s fascinate her since they are the only way for her to come close experiencing the emotions that were taken away from her.



### Agon

Agon got severely mutilated and almost turned to ashes after a wildfire and recovered within the facility he was kept in. His eyesight could not regenerate completely though. He can only differentiate between light values, making him attracted to light. He can only see when light is present making his "home" even more of a hellscape for him.



### Gnash ?

"gnash" not only collects one clavicle of his victims to use as a row of teeth, but also collects their right hands and cuts off their pinky. He immitates the 4 fingered effigy of this world's "god". He alters and humiliates it's reputation, basically mudding the waters of it's true meaning. He commits his acts of cruely in the name of "art", trying to show the limits of freedom of expression. He does this to spite this world's divinity and the concept of chosen destiny associated with it. He wants to prove that he is his own god, and is able to express his freedom without remorse or threshold.

He fears his lack of control and insignificance.

For GNASH killing and torture is like a form of art, something that challenges the norm. The rawest form of expression For him, murder is like "picking flowers"



Dust as a source of information, reflecting the people that caused it. A little microcosm or mirror of the reality around it.

Map patterns and landmarks turn out to be complex origami-like patterns

### I forgot the C, what a fucking idiot I am lmao

S-EEK O-BSERVE U-NIFY R-EPLICATE

Backronym

### old idea

Astroid/incomplete Ingwaz rune may represent 4 spheres(?)/planets(?) blocking a light source (sun[?]) complete Ingwaz similar to DNA string

ᛉ ᛦ ᛜ

Shadow figures as in Hand-made shadows - Hands of Scorle, his hands -> Story One of his hands has a missing finger (prob. pinky) - makes his hand look like the algiz symbol

### Revenant ideas

Stake goes through Hand and eye. Hand over half of face therefore left handed until hand is ripped off. Inspired by Cracknight.

Revenant Duo : One has ripped off face, the other wears it.



### Antagonists main goal(?) - old and perhaps a bit convoluted

Every piece of Information that the Desmocores incapsulate is connected to a domain existing outside the physical realm of this universe. Upon destruction of the Desmocore the information is distributed to that domain where it forms a weird singulary of pure entropy (information) - ergo pure order - coming full circle (His goal is to connect every sentient being to the domain and kill them and their universe. He then wants to redistribute the information into a new universe where one thing is different: Entropy increases randomly and endows everything in it with complete free will. The current universe's entropy and quantum paraticles are passively controlled by beings similar to his. He rebels against them without knowing it. Since he bound himself to this universe he is partially bound to its laws. He can change entropy distribution and create order but it can be influenced by it as well.)






/\ \|/ \/ |



2 weird sentries are scour-esque creatures that are more closely connected to the "dimensional core" and are therefore a lot stronger and have a different shape. They are like an even more evolved version of the scours that can split apart and modify their body. Every scour can achieve a similar form under very special circumstances.



Some scours that cannot fuse their minds instead choose to separate their body masses to build different entities that are only loosely connected to each other by distance. One of those bodies is often the dominant one while the other is more primitive in nature and embodies the more animalistic traits. These scours don't have to resemble classic scours but are other jumbled combinations of the components.

One of them is a vinossium-like scour with flags being the weapon-theme. Their other part is a dog like creature with the scour-mask as its head.

Another is a Krymuguard-like scour riding a huge beast

Another resembles the two Twiosk masks being seperated into two entities connected by their tails, they may wear bandanas with opposite emotion on them.

A skevellord who has a cyberpunk-esque suit with a lot of neon lights since he adores colors and bright things. Has a big monocular lens for one of the eyes and his barbles are inside a cone-like shape which creates a waning moon shape. His enwrapped bones have neon lighters. He can throw one of his bones to a place and another one to another, a third bone will be connected between the two like a railing which he can hold onto. It's his fast-travelling method. Doesn't like unpredictable things and is more of a loner obsessed with light.

Revenant inspired by Phineas Gage

> "Nothing below, nothing above. Nothing behind, left to right.”

> "Nothing below, nothing above. Nothing left behind or right.”

> "As soon as I entered that room I also entered her. She greeted me from every side, every corner. Everywhere I looked, she stared back, but I just couldn't recognize her."

> "Never question the maggots."
