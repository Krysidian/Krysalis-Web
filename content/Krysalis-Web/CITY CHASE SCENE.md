**Maybe a scoop chase scene in the "city"**

I think the story could benefit from having a moment where the trio splits up after an argument and that being the moment when [[Celia]] strikes and tries to get to Dina. She tries to manipulate her and get her to join her side, maybe shows her screenshots of Caleb's conversation with his friends or something else that "proofs" that she would be better of without him. Maybe she shows [[Dinara|Dina]] proof that her parents are still alive after all and that Scoop has lied (even though he misremembered). [[Dinara]] almost falls for it, but decides against it after all and either they have an epic fight straight on or she leaves, unsure and saying she'll think about it so the confrontation/fight can occur later. I also had the idea of [[Dinara]] having worn those old dresses because they were her sisters. They're vintage because they're like 12-15 years old. Her mother had dressed [[Dinara|Dina]] in them to remind herself of her little [[Nadya]], that's why she kept the one dress in the house even after everything. Not to remember Dinara's childhood but [[Nadya]]'s. Also I think it could be cool for arcs 1-2/3 to be about a human (Caleb) among Revenants while arc 3/4-5 focuses on Revenants (Dina and Scoop) among humans. So we get the whole whirl-around of world building and how those two universes clash together and how there's a literal zombie apocalypse going on in one end of the country while on the other, everything's fine and people hardly care
