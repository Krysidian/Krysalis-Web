# Ideas


Okay random thought I had: What if the thing with Dina, her mom and the devil is literally that she sold off her firstborn to the devil

That's why she was so cold towards her as a child, because she didn't want to get attached. But then [[Nadya]] disappeared and [[Zarina]] just didn't know how to suddenly embrace this child she had pushed away for years

(What if the devil has other plans for Dinara? What if her mom already had [[Nadya]] with another man and genuinely loved her, but then married [[Lev]] to be with someone whom she could use better to gain power. So when the devil asks for her firstborn, she says she already has a child and promises [[Dinara]] to him instead. She then raises her completely detached emotionally, because she thought she'd be taken by the devil eventually. But when [[Nadya]] disappears, [[Zarina]] thinks he's tricked her and taken her firstborn after all. I don't know what happens after that but here's the idea anyway makdksksks)

I also like how it would make Dinara's mistreatment appear entirely meaningless. So her mom suddenly does a 180 and controls her life thoroughly to shape her into the best person imaginable (
through a lot of tutoring, music lessons, sport etc etc) because she can't let this resource go unused
