"I just had another idea for a scene post Scoop joining the group:
In a moment if/when they revisit Dinas family home to look for plot relevant evidence (code for idk what's gonna happen, here's my idea) and they find it abandoned, taped off by the police and overgrown by mushrooms. Scoop is frozen by the door at first while [[Dinara|Dina]] runs inside and [[Caleb]] is perhaps torn between whom to stay with and support in that moment, but eventually [[Dinara|Dina]] calls out and both of them come to join her. She walks through the rooms, unsure of what she's looking for and asks the others to pick up random things for her, as she examines the remains of her old room, the halls, the dining room and basically tries to find anything important for the plot or meaningful to her personally. [[Caleb]] looks in the office rooms for anything to do with the mushroom/Revenant thing while Scoop stays close to Dinara. He's tense af the entire time and just as [[Dinara|Dina]] is about to enter the room she died in, she walks past and out into the garden.

She sits down outside and begins to lay out some of the things she found, among those: an old dress. (I like the idea of her never having had any toys but having had cute frilly dresses, because it conveys "You are the toy, you do not get to play. You are to obey and to do what is expected from you. Now sit still, be quiet and look pretty" )

Scoop sits down beside her on the terrace and she starts to talk about how it's odd, how they've died and never had a funeral. Because she wonders who would've come to say goodbye to her. They have a somber moment between them, Scoop says he would've come and surely [[Caleb]] too. (insert smile and eyeroll at their golden retriever) scoop says something about how funerals usually suck anyway but [[Dinara|Dina]] says she would've liked to have one anyway, "like a normal person with normal friends and a normal family. Who would miss me when I'm gone" "You're not gone" "No. But she is" [[Dinara|Dina]] says as we see the dress in her hands.
"Well", Scoop stands up, "Let's say our goodbyes then"

They get up and find a shovel, burying the dress in the garden, as [[Dinara|Dina]] says goodbye to a childhood she never really had.

Scoop asks if there's any other rooms she wants to investigate and she declines, saying she has everything she needs. We see the three of them leave the house (implication is that she feels fullfiled with the trio)"

***
 
Also I forgot to add to the funeral scene: 
As they talk about her not feeling connected to anything in the house anymore and really just grieving herself, she says how she keeps trying to find something there that she can't name. Maybe this is where he pulls out the second earring and maybe she buries those with the dress. The death of her childhood self and the death of her adult past combined in one grave. 

As they lay Dinas old dress into the grave, she asks Scoop if he wants to bury something of his as well. He says that he's not quite there yet, dryly jokes about not wanting to steal the show regardless.



Later when he meets the Scour who looks like his dead partner, (maybe they fight, maybe they just talk? Either way something inside him shifts and as he leaves he whispers "Goodbye" ) after that Scoop could maybe change from his old clothes to something different, wear his hair less uptight and slicked back and embrace the fact that his past is gone and he needs to keep going.

Also I like the idea if before the funeral scene where he reveals the earring, [[Dinara|Dina]] is capable of taking out her own earring herself, but if she later wants to put in another one, she'd require someone's hands.
As in, she can jank out this awful past and make peace with it but for a happy future, she needs friends by her side
