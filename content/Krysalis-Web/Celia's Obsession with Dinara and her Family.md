# Ideas


[[Celia]] wanting to know more about the family and the whole revenant thing would also be really fitting. I see her as kind of a control freak, maybe wanting to perfect what it means to be a revenant. And since she has since gigantic source of information she stumbles upon Dinara's case and become obsessed with it. And perhaps becomes obsessed with [[Dinara]] on a personal [[Lev]]el as well. Wanting to shape her to her liking perhaps? Like an eccentric over the top version of Dina's mother. Still a very rough idea though

Random Idea: When [[Celia]] first meets Dinara, her first words towards her are "Oh, I thought you'd be shorter" and if there's a panel of them together, full body, you can see that she's just a little shorter than [[Dinara]] while wearing platform boots (aka she tried to force an "eye to eye" thing but miscalculated, showing how she thinks she knows [[Dinara|Dina]] but she very much doesn't )
