## Ideas


1. Prologue: Schooltime, Caleb had friends, never got close to Dinara, never meant any harm just had other friends [[Calebs Reasons]]
2. Dinara mentions special places of interest, like the [[Everburning Forest]] other interests, only knowledge Caleb has
3. Dinara is outcast, bullied? #toBeAnswered Bad compromising photos of her [[The Unpleasant Photo]]
4. Graduation: Sees she is alone, goes to her and asks about her graduation photo etc. Talk about their future, the end of school. Dinara says noone likes her. Caleb promises they will meet again and keep in touch. [[Calebs Reasons]]
   ![[Calebs Reasons#^663a5e]]
5. 2-3 years later, Current Day: [[Class Reunion]] → Caleb notices that Dinara is missing, noone really cares and some don’t even remember her (Maybe same place they met up last). He leaves early
6. → Shows that he isn’t happy about his current life
7. People talk about Revenants etc. but don’t take it serious, snarky remarks etc.
8. Caleb feels upset about it and feels the guilt of making a promise he did not keep
9. Sees tourist attraction ad about place she mentioned ([[Everburning Forest]])
10. Searches for information, searches for photos, all are terrible so he chooses the least bad one.
11. Searching worlding building ideas: Revenant info? How the internet works
12. prints posters (pacing?) Summary vs Scene? #toBeAnswered 
13. Computer shows his plans and information he found.
14. Maybe a few friends (3) that are happy to help him (2 school friends and 1 new friend)
15. meetup with friends (Summary)
16. Drives with bus to the attraction ([[Everburning Forest]])
    1. Meets up with [[Scoop]] for the first time? (Has some personal business there too) #toBeAnswered
