## Ideas


When [[Caleb]] searched for a photo of [[Dinara]] to use in his Missing-Poster he could only find two usable images of her. 
He dismissed one of them immediately since it shows her in a very vulnerable and humiliated state (still gotta specify that). [[The Unpleasant Photo]] 
Other one is just her making and unintentionally funny and weird face. Not great, but the better of the two. He keeps the first photo hidden and is baffled how little records exist of her. Things like school photos etc. tend to veil her face or sheâ€™s just plain missing.
Maybe [[Scoop]] and his other Coworkers can be spotted in some too
