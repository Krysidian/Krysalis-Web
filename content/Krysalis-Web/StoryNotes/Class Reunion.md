## Ideas

- Maybe happening in the [[Abandoned Mall Bar]] that could be a central location
- Caleb feels alienated there since he hasn't seen most people in ages yet tries to bring back his charismatic persona
- Finds out that *seemingly* people are living a bright future that he cannot relate to since he is burned out on his Studies and isolated himself
- The [[Revenants|Revenant]] rumors can be heard here first but most don't seem to take it serious
	- making Caleb feel even more alienated since he studies something connected to these [[Anomalies]]
