# The Thespian




Design ideas: Mime, zipper, Matryoshka, Rubberhose/cartoony animation Accepted the concept of destiny and is therefore just "going with the flow". Thinks he can't do anything wrong since the concept is meaningless and his path is chosen anyway. He is a desciple of the divinity without even knowing it in person or its actual goal. Chooses not to speak for communication is almost meaningless for him. Only has "conversations" to taunt, mock and manipulate. Eveything is a stage and therefore art. In its eyes, it can find beauty in absolutely anything, even cruelty. It simply enjoys the spectacle and is eager to play an interesting role in it all.

His nemesis is "[[GNASH]]", someone who goes totally against his ideology. Yet he is still fascinated and engages within even temporarily teaming up. They both try to manipulate each other and try to get the upper hand. #toBeChanged
