# living forever


If you would live forever you would probably go insane. But you would probably also come to know every crevice of certain places. Know rules no-one else would understand. But perhaps your mind would be to fractured and worn out to make use of that knowledge.

I think it would affect everyone differently (Fire Punch depicts this very well)

Some lose their morals, others may grow dormant and delirious as if in a coma

Maybe some would go utterly insane and be beyond our comprehension.

Others might lose their memory and start over again. Like memory overflow. They would be the sanest since they are practically reborn. Perhaps only snippets of previous life cycles persist.
