# The CON MAN



The CON MAN Varrie teams up with was a very gifted child with extremely neglectful parents that threw him out as soon as he was 18. Though he was smart he never wanted to show his intellect and kept it all by himself. He was a classic bullied outsider and had a simple friendship with another very smart girl in the same class. That had to be kept hidden since it could have harmed both of ther "reputation". His mindset deteriorates and he grows scornful towards society while the girl sees a whole lot more opportunity. Even though she at first manages to cheer him up, her viewpoint of the world eventually makes him push himself away. While she eventually becomes a successful businesswoman, he lands on the streets and has to steal and trick people in order to survive. He also became a street artist. but his tattered clothes made him look even more illegitimate. Since he is smart he is able to avoid conflict, but one day he witnesses a mugging of a well dressed businessman. The con artist decides to steal the suit from the unconcious man and tries to take on a new identity as a street magician, eventually meeting a curious Varrie.
