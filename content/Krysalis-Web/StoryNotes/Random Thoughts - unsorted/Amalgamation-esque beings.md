# Amalgamation-esque beings


I want the first Hybrids/Abominations to resemble specific traits. They all have a somewhat direct connection to the divinity and its "Truth of Reality".

The one nicknamed "Fuon" and its split-mind form could be considered "Comfort" since it plays an important role in comforting the dying Desmocore and tries to lead them towards revelations.

The "Inverted Man" can become "Truth" since it is the culmination of an entire civilisation inside one body (parallels to Sourire's possible future) and had direct contact with the "Omnipresent Truth". It's a lot more harsh and dangerous and therefore in a more true neutral stance. It mirrors characters, society and aspects of the universe when interacted with.

It could be a possibility that Sourire will eventually absorb "Truth" in order to initiate the "Diluvian" which will have serious consequences to his psyche.
