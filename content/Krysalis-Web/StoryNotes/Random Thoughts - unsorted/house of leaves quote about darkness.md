# house of leaves quote about darkness


"When we are young, we fear something may lay with us in the darkness, just beyond where our vision can penetrate the shadows. As we grow older, and our hearts heavier, we realize that the true horror is to know the space beside us in bed is, and will likely remain, vacant."
