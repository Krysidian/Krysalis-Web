# MAP EMOTIOSK




Fused into a scour, plagued with the imagery of the map. Tormented by it it breaks apart its mask and sows a piece of cloth over it, veiling the upper portion, but to no avail. It is frail and very unstable living like an Emotiosk secluded in an abandoned facility. it tries its best to recreate the map by scratching and painting for all its lifetime. Arms and limbs are sharp and thin, it is slouched and constantly twitching. It has "appendages" on its shoulders that have an "orb" with liquid at the end. It can be used as a mechanic's level. It is obsessed with geometry and perfection.
