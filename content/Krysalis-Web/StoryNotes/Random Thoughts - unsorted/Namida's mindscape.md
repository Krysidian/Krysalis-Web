# Namida's mindscape



Namida's mindscape is a mixture of a autumn styled forest similar to the gloomy forest she grew up with. A lot of self made wind chimes hang on the branches, looking similar to the ones she made herself in the past. It looks like multiple areas of her life weirdly merged together and has a huge crystallized area containing memories she made with Xtal and Sourire, showing the impact he made on her life. He also somewhat represents the wind chimes she made as a "child"
