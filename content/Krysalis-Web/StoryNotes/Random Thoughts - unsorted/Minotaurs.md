# Minotaurs


Incoorperate the concept of the Minotaur into my universe and its rule. Use House of Leaves as a reference.

A Minotaur is a title given to an entity that possesses a very specific and intense emotional connection to another individual that is considered it's "custodian".

A custodian can have one or more minotaurs of often differing intensity.

A Minotaur is bound to one and rarely multiple people and even a custodian can be a minotaur of another. It can be an actual individual or a physical/psychological manifestation brought into the world by the custodian. (Like a poltergeist or Curse from JJK)

The "intensity" of a Minotaur is measured with a spectrum rather than rigid categories.

What makes a Minotaur is the emotional divide between positive and negative emotions and memories related to a specific entity (often times person). The bigger the divide or contrast the stronger the Minotaur.

Example: someone you love dearly is also directly connected to an awfully tragic and traumatic event thus making both positive and negative emotions inseparable when the custodian thinks about the Minotaur.

The emotional turmoil is what strengthens the Minotaur and even lets it enter the physical realm as a representation of that turmoil.

Custodians that hide their emotions can keep their Minotaur at bay yet they often come back and manifest in even stronger form while emotional Custodians may have very aggressive and ever-haunting ones that are relentless. Only custodians that can healthily control their emotions are able to accept and live with their Minotaur

### Example

Scoop is Dinara's Minotaur while the reverse is also true. Und

But Scoop also has a bigger, stronger Minotaur that manifests itself as a quiescent Hazmat Suit and the black, drowning rain it drags along. The Minotaurs Origin is his dearest love that he eventually lost. (Their favourite place was a dusty part of the mushroom forest full of ashes where both had to wear gas masks)

SCOOP learned and foolishly accepted that he does nothing more than hurt people even if he tries not to. That makes him so apathetic to everything. He burned every bridge, isolated himself from anything beyond a surface level and fear based relationship. Yet he still holds onto memories. Can't let go. His last act of compassion only happened because of the disaster he caused. He revived Dinara hoping he could right at least one wrong in his life. But now he questions his decision yet again. Maybe she should have stayed dead. Maybe she should have never learned anything beyond that day.

Probably: Custudians need to be Revenants, only they can form a physical Minotaur
