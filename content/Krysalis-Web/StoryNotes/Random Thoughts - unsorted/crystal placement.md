# crystal placement




[[Revenants]] have a tendency to hide their life crystal in a place of sentimentality and personal importance. Some move it where their heart was. Some lock it behind something to shield it, weakening them in the process. Those who keep their crystal where it appeared (mainly the throat) tend to wear their secrets on their sleeves, are more direct and open or don't really care. Scoop hiding his crystal withing Dinara symbolizes that she is the most important part of his life now.
