# Scarecrow Golems

Old Name. Raghosius (Rag+Ghost I think)


The Scarecrow golems are infused with the same essence that the scours/revenants inhabit within the crystal. They also contain something similar. They are basically the inorganic prototype version of the scours. Something infused with anomalous life. But these golems are a lot more primitive and cannot contain memories and therefore never form personality. They are only created with basic instincts and tasks and therefore also never deviate from their behavior. But they can also never learn. They seem like mindless husks but in actuality they are minds trapped inside a memoryless husk of a body. They are more similar to scours than one might think. Different flesh, same soul.

There are exceptions though. Very rare cases have seem to be able to remember and therefore develop. But most cases are only able to experience memories when connected to a symbiote. It will then inhabit the same memories and therefore a similar consciousness as the symbiote. Almost a direct copy. Upon disconnection the "Golem" will lose it's or better, the symbiote's memories. They may be "copies" of the symbiote but they are able to understand what it means to disconnect. And some think long enough to fear that thought. (inspired by soma)
