# Crystal Motif




Note: Use the leitmotif of crystal and light to explain and visualize the machinations of this world. Information is "crystallized" (Desmocore, but also metaphorically). Information like memories are shown as "shards" and the universe basically consists of randomly distributed "crystals of entropy". The divinity clashes the concepts of order and chaos, which are much closer related that it might seem at first. It wants this universe to end and reset. It's basically trying to commit suicide in order to bring down the universe connected to it with it. It is aware that this world is locked within the boundaries of predictability and therefore destiny. Its the only real source of unpredictable information. At least so it thinks. "Amplitude" is an unmeasured factor as well. In order for the divinity to kill itself it needs to compress all the information of the universe to finally destroy it at once. Basically creating pure order - the ironic opposite of what the divinity wants to achieve. But it thinks that upon destruction a new big bang will form, creating a universe Independent from the strings of over dimensional forces. The divinity tries to predict everything, planning everything and "simulating" (perhaps even looping) the scenario over and over to create the perfect chain reaction to pave the way to ultimate cataclysm. Things that are out of the divinity's view of predictability and therefore contradicting fate are considered "aberrations". Some are short moments of specific events or characters but some universal assets are constant aberrations. Examples are Amplitude, "the dead man's switch". Sourire, Namida and Silvia are also capable of anomalous activity.

Represent order with black and white while chaos is white noise. Chaotic aberrations are represented with chromatic aberrations, meaning RGB split Namida + Sourire are Red+Cyan split. Amplitude is white noise.

Crystals are able to fracture light - creating aberrations.

The divinity is like a fragment of this universe. The culmination of universal thought. It's the shared subconscious gaining conciousness. Yet now it is trapped withing the limitations of a mortal body and cannot handle the ultimate emotional turmoil and chaos of life itself. So it seeks to destroy itself in desperation. It can only die when everything else dies, since it is directly connected to the universe. Just not physically. This is also the reason it cannot influence the world directly anymore, the way its original form was able to. It can only plant thoughts, manipulate and live within a mind. It is a meme. And Shapeless is just the extension of it, a right hand. Someone that gave up all of their ego and personality do spread a memetic disease. Converting life into pseudolife, ergo: Scours, Revenants, and the robotic sentries will give the divinity an indirect physical connection. The crystals are what connects them to it.
