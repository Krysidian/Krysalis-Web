# Sourire - Some Info and Ideas


Sourire has the ability to absorb any organic matter that is not assigned to a [[Desmocore]]. This will result in the liquification of the biomass which will increase Sou's mass overall. He can control the gained substance to his liking and might lose biomass over time. But it also has negative side effects since he also absorbs fragments of the "biomass'" Psyche if they have one. He will gain parts of other people's personality trait, thoughts and memories, which will cloud his sense of self even more than it already is, contributing to his overall confusion and emotional turmoil. Which is why he has developed a fear of consuming biomass overall. He doesn't even eat and tries his best not to absorb the mass around him. It's not completely unavoidable since he needs energy to survive but he holds it at a minimum. Which is why he apprears rather frail or lean.

His overall theme consists of his Leit-Instrument Piano together with ink and painting. But his overarching theme is "The Flood". He is a current or stream of ink, brining contours back into the world. The absorbed biomass and it's black liquid form resemble that. He may even sacrifice his sense of self by absorbing masses of people in order to become the "Diluvian", in which he controls an ocean full of "Ink".

But he tries to refrain himself from killing and if he does, he rarely absorbs them. But sometimes he is forced since he is majorly injured or his opponent can only be killed in that manner, leading to common dilemmas. Other scours maintain mass and energy in slightly different ways or have no need to and therefore don't have Sourire's Problems.
