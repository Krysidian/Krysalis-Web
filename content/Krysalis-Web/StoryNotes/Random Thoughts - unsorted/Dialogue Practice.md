# Dialogue Practice




NAMIDA and SPINEEYE are on a veranda/balcony, the sun is setting and you can see HAMMERGIRL in the distance. She is playing, or rather play-fighting with her little symbiote, who serves as a hammer. Both seem to have a lot of fun. The two Adults on the porch observe her slightly, enjoying the cool of the night that slowly creeps in as the sun slowly fades in the distance. NAMIDA has a tiny plate with all kinds of tiny edibles in her hands and takes a little bite from time to time. SINEYE only holds a small cold beer can in his hand, enjoying the view, in two ways. As the silence seems to make itelf more prominent and the awkwardness of the situation slowly sneaks in, they start a little smalltalk, despite both of them being terrible at it.

NAMIDA: _cough_ Ehm, what are we even looking at?

SPINEEYE: Lookin? are we supposed to be looking at something, ha? I thought we just here to enjoy the evenin and our _looks at Namida's tiny plate_ "dinner".

NAMIDA: Oh. You just seemed so focused looking back there. I mean, what is she actually doing? She is going to hurt herself flailing that thing around.

SPINEEYE: Heh, nah. She's just playin now. And believe me, she knows what she's doing. I tought that girl.

NAMIDA: To swing a hammer?

SPINEEYE: Well, of course not, haha. One day she came to me and asked me to teach her some basics in self defence. Even her little buddy wanted to be a part of it. You may think it came out of the blue, but I kinda expected it, knowing the peeps around her. I mean, we basically grew up in the same neighborhood. And she got so obsessed with all these "heroes" on TV teaming up with components. Was slightly surprised she held out for that long.

NAMIDA: Heroes? Like actual superheroes, if that's what they're called _chuckles_ pardon my ignorance there.

SPINEEYE: Eeeh, not really. Not like those flying guys in fancy suits you see in comics or the like. Probably mostly just some goons in dangerous areas trying to make a name out of themselves. And in the places, where componentes WEREN'T despised, or even component meltin pots were the perfect brooding ground for amateur vigilantism. Some did "good" deeds while also livin a criminal life behind the backs of public. Some were just straight up incompetent or attention whor-.. oops, sorry Nam. Mostly Controversial figues on TV but especially liked by the little folk here, thinkin they could one day do good and improve this shithole.

NAMIDA: Well, that sounds a lot less... heroic I guess. And she reminds you of those guys? I mean, she definetely seems to be one of those passionate kids.

SPINEEYE: Honestly, not really. Her ambitions are a lot more deep rooted. She may be inspired by them but would've probably chosen a similar path no matter what. She actually reminds me more of another lady. A very fine lady, if I so say myself. I mean, haven't seen her but I just know it.

NAMIDA: Haven't seen? But you know her?

SPINEYE: Oh Maan, she goes waay back! Was one of those OG Hero Vigilantes that appeared only once or twice on TV. Never wanted the attention. Never revealed her identity but did some absolutely sick stuff. Like, you know, ACTUAL hero stuff, and never took the credit for it. I think she even stopped a kidnapping in this neighborhood once. But that was decades ago I think. She was active before I was born, like, damn! But I'm telling you, this girl was a Vigilante for all the right reasons, and probably a great pal for her Symbiote partner. A looker too, despite never showing her face. But I'm getting off track. But yeah, she never bathed in the praise and gratitude of the public, only did what she thought was right. At least that's how I like to imagine it... Kinda like my girl over there, and honestly, kinda like you if I think about it... [He slightly backs up, getting a bit redder worrying he was giving too much away]

NAMIDA: Heh, if you say so.. But true, she was pretty heroic by definition. And, I mean, you seem to really like her, just like ms. Hammer Girl swinging there!

SPINEEYE: Yeah, yeah, haha, but you know, I was always more of a brother for her, if you get me.

NAMIDA: I..don- -_-'

SPINEEYE: But don't tell her that! No clue what goes on in that mind of her's but i don't know. I kinda don't want her to be like that lady.

NAMIDA: Why is that? Seems like quite an idol for her. At least a good motivator, right?

SPINEEYE: This woman didn't disappear from the face of the earth for no reason, Nam. She either bit the dust or there was dirty laundry she hid from the public as well. I just don't trust heroes. Never have, never will. No matter how noble they may seem or how much I might appreciate their work. She may be fine, but I don't want to know the full picture if I'm honest. "Don't meet your heroes" and all that jazz, ya know? And I don't want HAMMERGIRL to end up like this.

NAMIDA: But you probably also don't want to stop her, knowing her passion, right?

SPINEEYE: Yup.. just want to check up on her to know everythin is on the right track. And now she is entangled with all the stuff you and your pals are dealin with. I can't really do anything to stop that. I just.. I don't think she's ready to become a hero.

NAMIDA: I think none of us are.
