Ok so I had this old and half baked idea for a long while (it's very rough so bear with me ^^'')
So if you remember the plague doctor I made in 3D once, that character was supposed to play some sort of "deal with the devil" role in the story after scoop is desperate to bring her back. 
So revenants have these red crystals that are their source of life, stuck in their throat (normally) but either her' s is incomplete and brittle or he's too aware of the very mortal state even Revenants are in.

I had the rough imagery of this doctor being an anomalous being offering things to new revenants. Mostly safe and extended life. Revenants are physically bound to that crystal, which is their one big weakness. But this doctor would take that crystal, keep it and extend it's reach so the revenant can basically roam free, always connected to the crystal (like extended WiFi) 

Ok this is super vague. But Maybe scoop knows about they're whereabouts during the time where [[Dinara]] dies and searches for it in hopes to strike that deal. But this time he wants to become prepared and so he switches his own crystal with that of Dinara. 
He offers  Dinara's crystal pretending it's his own hoping the doctor wouldn't notice and make [[Dinara]] part of the deal.
So during the story the crystal [[Dinara]] carries (where the choker is meant to be a direct protection) is actually Scoops while scoop doesn't have one. So everyone thinks scoop offered his own crystal for "immortality" even though he gave [[Dinara]] that deal. 
But he's still physically bound to the crystal and therefore can't be too far away from Dinara. Another reason he's always so close nearby. Though he tries to find ways to extend  his reach and leave her more space.

What Scoop didn't know was the catch of the deal (he basically gambled and did the switcheroo as a safety measure)

That's probably the most vague part (yeah, I know, rip) but my initial idea was that the Plague Doctor simply mentions a date after the deal. And it's alluded to that this is an expiration date. After that the Plague Doctor would seek out the deal-maker, void the pact and destroy the crystal. Basically putting a timer on the immortality. 

So Scoop and by extension [[Dinara]] would be chased down at some point and scoop fears that this thing noticed his trick more than dying himself.



I mean, why not both? He's allowed to care about two people's survival XD
What could be an interesting element to add would be Scoops initial motivation vs how that changes
