## Ideas


- [[Caleb]] first goes to the [[Everburning Forest]] in hopes of finding [[Dinara]] since that was a place she wanted to visit according to a little convo they had in the past
- (Think about emotional significance of the Forest when it comes to Dinara)
- Since it's only visitable during a specific time in the year, this might be a good first place to look for her
	- Small timeframe where he can find her there
	- If she escaped her parents she would probably have taken enough money with her to go there (since the parents are rich)
	- Probably wasn't there before because *Insert reason why it didn't rain in the Forest for the last couple years*
