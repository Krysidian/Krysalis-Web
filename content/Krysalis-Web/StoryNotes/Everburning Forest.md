## Ideas


- A [[Mushroom Forest]] inspired by tinder fungus That's constantly burning and regrowing
- Ashes fly towards a certain place because of steady wind where the unnaturally white ash falls like snow
- Only during a specific timeframe in summer is it humid and the rain intense enough to calm the flames
	- making it a popular tourist attraction
	- old Roads and even houses become visible meaning that the Forest appeared somewhat recently and spontaneously (Darkwood reference?)
