## Ideas


Dinara's life has been defined by conformity, always trying to do what others wanted even though these weren't her desires to the point where she doesn't even quite know what she wants anymore

Even after turning, this behavior is deeply ingrained. She may be acting more rebellious and intense, yet that's not who she truly is, but thinks she has to be, since all the other undead around her act that way and she desperately wants to break free from her past subconciously
