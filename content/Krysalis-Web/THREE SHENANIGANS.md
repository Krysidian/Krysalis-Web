Possible Shenanigans:
Caleb and [[Dinara]] meeting the Ghost Town where the Revenant
Maybe they flee on the mentioned boat. and drag Scoop along without knowing, new area unlocked!

Maybe the next place is more urban than the one before. Non human civilization.

For the pre eviction scenes it would be important to have this sort of Verlauf: For the first encounter it's something mildly dangerous but manageable for Dinara. [[Caleb]] is a little mortified of her but also sorta impressed by her and dependent on her as a guide. She's leading the mission with confidence, delighted to have someone interested in her as a person for once. 

Mini encounter of her telling him stuff about the mushrooms and existence as a Revenant. Very much a "Let me show you my world" moment. He in turn tells her all about the theoretical knowledge he has about that place. One or two moments of exploration of the place and a little bit of downtime in the evening as they set up camp and she tells him about her grand adventures (maybe she wants to make it a guessing game about what he's been up to/what she's been doing in the past years where they hadn't seen each other?) 

Second encounter, possibly the ghost town and the dude. [[Dinara|Dina]] is slightly in over her head, trying to prove to [[Caleb]] how cool and badass she is now by fighting against the Revenant. It possibly doesn't go well and with a lot of luck, they get out of there alive. (maybe Scoop helped from afar idk? ) [[Caleb]] is a little disillusioned now, beginning to see how she's not all that powerful as she claimed. When he tells her they should've just ran, she gets angry at him, disliking being called a Coward. While he patches her up as she got injured they argue over her recklessness and she's like "I thought we were friends, why are you criticising me so much" and he let's slip that they weren't really friends. She starts the questioning and finds out that he barely knew her etc, siehe vorheriger Ideen dump dazu. Her abandonment issues kick in and she convinces herself to stay by his side

Third encounter, something happens where she proves herself to be a very competent fighter and he proves himself a c[[Lev]]er planner and mushroom expert. They see that they work well together but it's a meh moment as maybe [[Dinara|Dina]] does some maggot stuff that freaks him out very much. So in the aftermath maybe [[Caleb]] says something about her death and she's reminded of how she doesn't really have a family anymore that triggers her to snap and begin to force him out, ordering him to not look at her because she doesn't want to see either his pity or his disgust.
