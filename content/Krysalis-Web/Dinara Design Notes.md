Okay so, some changes I'd suggest; add wraps to her knees to obscure the threshold and also because she was a fighter, she knows to wrap exposed places that are used as weapons. Also maybe the blades came out of her like wolverine claws, so maybe she (or scoop) instinctively bandaged it up?

Also because this is how it would be with IRL amputees, I left her knees and added the blades below. Allows for more motion

The cuts of her hands toward the cutlery could look more interesting if they were diagonal? Idk just a thought, also to avoid horizontal lines, as they make a character look balanced. But this barbie is mentally unstable

Striped pyjama shorts to add a little bit of childish innocence and texture without being too complex

The necklace is the one truly soft and round thing in the design, signifying a past lost where she was allowed to be innocent and sweet. Also it has the fly in it and is shaped like either a teardrop or an egg. Death and rebirth and all that, encapsulated in something [[Nadya]] maybe bought for her little sister because she knew she'd find it interesting


It was meant to be a bralett actually! To subtly imply that even at her most comfortable she was still always on edge in her parental home (also because I can't imagine anything more uncomfortable than being undead and not having any type of support for my chest ajdksksksk like, yes that is a priority, I will die on this hill)
