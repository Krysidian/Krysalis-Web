Dinas mom being so caught up in trying to make something of herself that she doesn't care, she's stepping over the corpse of her own daughter to achieve it. She doesn't care that she's the main thing keeping her child down while she herself keeps rising

She's so obsessed with the idea of success and money, she doesn't see that she's worse than any man around her




"I could kill you if I wanted" "You wouldn't dare" "Don't dare me then" #quote
