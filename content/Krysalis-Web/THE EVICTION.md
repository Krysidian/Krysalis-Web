Okay upfront: You're familiar with the Orpheus and Euridice myth? The scene where he leads her out of the underworld but gets scared because he can't hear her footsteps so he turns around and that's when she fades away, for them to never see each other again? 

Now imagine: After [[Caleb]] finds Dina, she tries to kill him and he runs, she protects him from other remnants and he tells her he's been looking for her, she gets moved by that emotionally and is really happy at first, prompting him to tell her more about their lives back then. They have 2-3 smaller shenanigans going on to have them spend more time together (evading dangers, looking for food, exploring the landscape as she teaches him a little about the remnants and he teaches her about the mushrooms)

She keeps asking about her past and he's hesitant but she's persistent and eventually he tells her the truth: she was a bit of an outsider with a horrible family. She realises that he barely knew her. 
She asks about his friends and family and finds out that in comparison to her, [[Caleb]] has things and people to live for. This makes the mood swing down tremendously. [[Dinara|Dina]] becomes a lot more grim and eventually tells him that he needs to leave, this is a land of the dead and he isn't safe there. 

Caleb insists that he won't leave her, but she threatens him, going back into scary monster mode (emotionally) and telling him he'll have to leave or she'll change her mind about keeping him alive. After that she doesn't talk to him anymore. (personal interpretation that he wears his emotions on his face pretty openly so she tells him to turn and start moving, not to look at her with those pitiful eyes. Headcanon here that Dinas parents didn't look at her much but ignored her a lot and that whenever anyone witnessed the neglect/abuse they just gave her compassionate looks instead of speaking up or helping her)

She makes him walk to the edge of the forest, prodding at his back with her knife hand whenever he tried to look at her.
Just as he's about to exit the forest, she stops a few metres away, to be shielded from human eyes by the trees, and he keeps walking until he reaches the edge. Then he turns and looks at her, both of them expecting each other to retreat, but they don't.

He realizes that she can never go back to living as a human and that beyond the façade, she's terrified of the world she lost
Alternatively he tells her that he'll take her back to the human world where she can be safe if only he'll explain the whole situation and that's why they're on the way to the edge. But on their journey filled with shenanigans, she realises that he barely knew her and that she doesn't have a life to return to

This could also be a killer moment for Scoop for show up and [[Dinara|Dina]] suddenly be in need of someone to help her and [[Caleb]] getting to prove that he does care about her, despite everything



During the fight of EVICTION DAY [[Dinara]] says something to scoop that takes him aback and gives both some time to either attack him or flee. (maybe his real name)
