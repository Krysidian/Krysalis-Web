## Flavor Text Ideas

- on the side of a wall that the player cannot actually se, only accessed by randomly hovering over the place: 
 > There is something hanging on this wall
 > ...
 > You don't want to look at it anymore.
- pictures hanging on the wall, some are empty frames, some are a bit crooked, and a few even have people on them. But when interacting with those ones you only read:
  > You don't know these people 
  > they're just photos of models used for displaying the frames
- a table with one chair next to it. The other ones are tucked away somewhere, implying he does not get a lot of guests. Maybe you can still see two plates or something similar because someone he still misses used to be there.
