## What I did Today

dreamt about school again. I think we were having math and Vincent and another unknown female student were making some weird but fun performance act. Something called "and actually". There was even a park nearby called that somehow related. Probably inspired by the whole "yes and" philosophy. It was amusing. Oddly enough I mentioned that dream to Vincent in another dream knowing it wasn't real. So a dream in a dream. That dream was just us having a final summer day kinda school day where we were cleaning stuff up and played some games in class. Something to do with old school marriage. I was the only one that did not marry anyone. Also had a heart to heart with Baris and the old Tim but context is missing. Nostalgic dream, not a bad one. Just times I can never return to. #dream
