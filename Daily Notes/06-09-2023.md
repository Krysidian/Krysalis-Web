## What I did Today

## Ideas

- Flashback
- Suggests a nickname in the past to show his potential friendship
- Maybe a teacher is at the [[Class Reunion]] and shows that he used to be a good student
- [[Seeing a Comet at the Perfect Moment]] as a backstory and current event -> [[Dinara]] has a deja vu (perhaps memories return) or only Caleb remembers
  Parallels between scenes, the current version being a moment of tranquility, the  past perhaps the opposite. Now the friendship is close but there is still stuff that needs to be worked out.
- A moment where scoop notices that scoop is sabotaging his own wishes and endangers Caleb and Dinara
- scoops helping as a subconscious way of enacting control, not malicious 
- Dinara during ballet plays snow white fork related character, swan dance




A show where throughout the entire season you occasionally see a statue appear in multiple places and during some episode the characters find out that that thing moves, just very slowly. It's indestructible and no-one knows what it does and what purpose it serves.
The final episode would be the reveal in which you see the entirety of the season from the statues perspective like time-lapse in which it moves regular speed and the seemingly random positions and movements finally make sense
