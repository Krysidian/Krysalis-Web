## Ideas

Midnight Cities:

Cities made of giant stinkhorn- like mushrooms that make up big pillars with hats that cover up the entire city, shrouding it in darkness. It kinda looks like a giant tree farm and the gaps are where buildings are built etc. There are also buildings carved into the mushrooms. It's a cyberpunk like neon city where the [[Vinossium]] can live in certain districts. It's a melting pot for humans and anomalous life [[Mushroom Forest]]
