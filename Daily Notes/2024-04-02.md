## Ideas

Guy with amazing sense of direction gets kidnapped is able to exactly know where he brought by tracking the amount of streetlights he saw through the sack over his head. He's aware of the average distance they are apart and calculated the driving speed with that. He also counted the gaps in which there were no street lights and memorized the turns the car made and that he felt. And by doing that he could approximate his current whereabouts.
