## What I did Today

## Ideas

- from a dream: Characters fought and tried everything in order to save a few friends that had died for some reason. Through weird shenanigans, they end up in a Dreamlike scene where for them everything seems to have worked out and all characters go their separate ways, content with what they accomplished. Only after some time, when they are alone or going through the city, a single thought flashes through their mind, that breaks the illusion:
  "**_insert name_** is still dead." #idea #dream
