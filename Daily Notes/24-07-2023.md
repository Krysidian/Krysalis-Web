## What I did Today


--- 
## Ideas

[[Varrie]] inner Monologue/Introduction idea:


> I 
> enjoy
> Life.
> When wake up in the morning, when I make myself something to eat.
> When I see my friends, go out with them all. See them smile. See them cry.
> At parties, during meetings, at funerals
> I enjoy Life.
> When people around me feel things that I can't.
> I like being around those that are  happy, I feel content seeing their pain. 
> When the people I love die, when those around me turn to hate me, when everything I built up to feel normal crumbles around me.
> I enjoy Life.
> I enjoy it to it's fullest, so much
> I don't even know what it means anymore.
