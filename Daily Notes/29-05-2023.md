## What I did Today

## Ideas

>  every night I see it crawling on my wall, my ceiling. a centipede as long and thick as my arm. It just curls up right where my eyes lead me when I want to sleep. I feel like I'm paralyzed by it, can't move a muscle, cannot scream but I am wide awake, it's the only thing I can pay attention to. So I count its segments. Every day, the number differs, increases. Maybe it's another critter every night, perhaps it's growing together with me, or I just take longer to count them all before finally falling asleep
