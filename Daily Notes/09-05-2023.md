## What I did Today

### Dream
Dream was vaguely about a fictional movie that was a bout a female protagonist going through an existential crisis. The crisis is caused by humanity scientifically proving that absolutely nothing exists after death and that we simply cease to exist. This leads to a ton of unrest in the world and the protagonist tries everything to find the solution for immortality but has to slowly accept that grim aspect of life [[Dream Note]]
