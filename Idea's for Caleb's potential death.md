(I have this image in my head of [[Caleb]] dying in Dinas and Scoops arms. His breath getting more and more shallow, eyes wide and terrified out of his mind. The other two trying to press on the wound, keep him alive, carry him to safety but they can't. They collapse and he let's out his last breath, hands still desperately clinging to his friends  
And so ends Caleb. As the other two can barely comprehend how this human they haven't known for long had just made them feel like they themselves had died again)

Or also interesting: The devil making that offer to Scoop again, to offer up his life to save [[Caleb]] and him finally saying "I can't. I can't do it. He wouldn't want this. I don't want this" because he learned that he is worth staying alive
