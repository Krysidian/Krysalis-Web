# Ideas


Hm I think it would be more interesting if she's lucid about it. Like, she remembers being seven, going to her sisters room and finding it suddenly empty, running to her parents and them just not knowing what to do. For a second their facades crack and then they're sealed forever, harsher and colder than ever before. And for days she still goes around the house, looking for her, but she's gone. And only the servants whisper the truth among themselves
Every sweet memory of the two of them together becomes sour for years. Only later when she understands why she left, does she find comfort in them again

Maybe she and her sister didn't see one another that often so she only has like a dozen memories to pull from. Usually birthdays or other family meetings?


Oh like that idea! And maybe those older memories are actually the more vivid ones. The newer ones are a hazy, awful mess. Cause that would also still work with that scene where she first meets Caleb. She first wants to turn him cause that's what the other revenants do but she notices that he's been searching for her and that she's apparently missed but doesn't quite know why. So she wants to find more about what happened about her life and death while Scoop's wary of that.
