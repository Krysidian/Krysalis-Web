# Note Taking Horror Game


Horror game where taking actual notes is a main mechanic. You have a notebook that works like an actual text program and you should take notes of your surroundings and weird details that stick out to solve later puzzles. You won’t get any direct help from the game like a questbook and notes aren’t written for you to tell you that a specific Item will be important later. You have to figure that out yourself

But to make the mechanic more enjoyable than just a simple notebook the game can detect certain words, maybe even phrases that will make the game react in certain ways. Like highlighting the word, giving you the option to interact with your own text so your character says something or maybe even paranormal stuff can be triggered using the text within your notebook #idea/game/horror
