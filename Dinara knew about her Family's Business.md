[[Dinara's Cowardice]]

- - - 
# Ideas


Basically! Also thinking about how much she knows about the whole illegal drug+killing business. I think she'd start to get a hunch over the years but actively chooses to not engage and stay ignorant. Cause that stuff's rough
That's an interesting angle, because it makes her complicit
Also adds some cowardice which can be used for deep rooted guilt, which is always fun
Another reason she subconsciously overcompensates, pretending to be overconfident fearless
