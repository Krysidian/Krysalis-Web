What if her sister isn't dead, what if she just left at some point. Using the skills she acquired through years of learning how to play the game her parents play, she just vanished. And now either her parents pretend that she died or that she never existed at all. But still there's this unreachable shadow looming over Dina

Maybe she wouldn't know how to feel about it either? Oscillating between bitterness, abandonment, anger and understanding. After all, she'd have left too. But she still feels this pang of "Why didn't you take me with you? Was I not enough of a reason to stay?" 

It would be really fascinating Imo if in the time between her leaving and [[Dinara|Dina]] dying, [[Nadya]] dies too, but of something entirely unrelated like a ski accident or something. To kinda hammer home the thing that she really did escape this, even in death, her family couldn't touch her anymore

And then it kinda cuts right into the grief of knowing she left and never came back
