Out that's an interesting angle too! How she left abandoned from a young age and suddenly she's being sought out

Yeah, she is so used to being alone and not liked (even feared because of her family connections) that she's baffled someone tried to find her. Even if she doesn't quite know yet, why she is so taken aback by that aspect.

For most she was just the weird, socially awkward rich girl and for other's she meant trouble cause who knows what her family might do if you interact with her in the wrong way
