Like, in some panels you could show mushrooms grow in between walls and from the ceiling, behind portraits etc
To show that this is beyond their control now                    
I have this very vivid image of [[Dinara|Dina]] going down the hall, framed from a bird's eye view as we see her from the ceiling, the panel walls framed with mushrooms
 You could have her mention it to her dad at the beginning at some point, because she's concerned it might be mold. But he just dismisses it. Chekhovs mushroom
 You could also show how the spores are out of control with for example, [[Dinara|Dina]] finding a dead mouse and going outside to bury it, only to show that later, the spot in the ground, that she chose has been opened up
