[[Dinara's Keepsakes]]

- - - 
# Ideas


Additional angst: Dramatic talks about corruption and mafia shit before a close up shot of Dinara's dad stepping on it, completely ignorant of whose it is or it even being there. Followed by [[Scoop]] glaring at him and carefully picking it up

[[Scoop]] finds it, keeps it and doesn't return it cause he doesn't want [[Dinara]] going back to her past but maybe later when they're on better terms he does which leads to her being happy first and then plummeting down into sobering reality.
