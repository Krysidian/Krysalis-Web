I just had the image of a scene flash before my eyes where maybe [[Caleb]] and [[Dinara|Dina]] find an abandoned shop in the woods and they use the opportunity to get some supplies and also clothes for [[Caleb]] to better blend in with the other creatures there

And so they have a little Montage of them trying to make him look less human and more punk, then he goes to change into the clothes they picked out. When he comes back, [[Dinara|Dina]] is standing in front of a broken mirror, holding a dress in front of herself, looking at her reflection

Reaction shot of [[Caleb]] as he realises this is the same color as the dress she wore at the prom

It could be funny to have [[Caleb]] then be all serious and sad like "I never did ask you for that dance" and she looks at him for a moment with vulnerability in her eyes before snapping back into her facade, laughing it off with "Good choice, I would've declined"

"Bet you can't dance for shit anyway!" she mocks him, shoving the dress into his arms and walking past. He stumbles for a moment, before turning a little annoyed but enamoured, grinning back like "Oh I sure can, when I'm being challenged!"

Dina turns and looks at him suspiciously before breaking into a smile * optional silly dance off ensures*
